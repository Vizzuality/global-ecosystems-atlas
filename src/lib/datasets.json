    "abstract": "The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM) shows the types of vegetation that occur across the Arctic—between the Arctic Ocean to the north and the northern limit of forests (“treeline”) to the south. Here, environmental and climatic conditions are extreme, with a short growing season and low summer temperatures.\n\nThe region supports plants such as dwarf shrubs, herbs, lichens and mosses, which grow close to the ground. As one moves southward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth increases , allowing the size, abundance, and variety of plants to increase. Other environmental controls, such as elevation, topography, soil chemistry, soil moisture, and the past history of plant colonization, also influence the distribution of plant communities. The colors on the map indicate the differences that occur in the outward appearance of vegetation.\n\nAn international team of Arctic vegetation scientists representing the six countries of the Arctic—Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States—prepared the map. Methods, additional thematic maps, detailed descriptions of the 16 map units, and photos of representative plant communities and species are on the reverse side. Get a more detailed overview at About the CAVM.\n\nThe Raster Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (Raster CAVM) map groups over 400 described plant communities into 16 vegetation types, glaciers, saline water, and freshwater at 1-km resolution. It builds on the strengths of the original CAVM, using the same legend, extent and projection, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping of Arctic vegetation.",
    "detailed_description": "Land cover maps are the basic data layer required for understanding and modeling ecological patterns and processes. The Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map (CAVM), produced in 2003, has been widely used as a base map for studies in the arctic tundra  . However, the relatively coarse resolution and vector format of the map were not compatible with many other data sets. We present a new version of the CAVM, building on the strengths of the original map, while providing a finer spatial resolution, raster format, and improved mapping. The Raster CAVM uses the legend, extent and projection of the original CAVM. The legend has 16 vegetation types, glacier, saline water, freshwater, and non-arctic land. The Raster CAVM divides the original rock-water-vegetation complex map unit that mapped the Canadian Shield into two map units, distinguishing between areas with lichen- and shrub-dominated vegetation. In contrast to the original hand-drawn CAVM, the new map is based on unsupervised classifications of seventeen geographic/floristic sub-sections of the Arctic, using AVHRR and MODIS data (reflectance and NDVI) and elevation data. The units resulting from the classification were modeled to the CAVM types using a wide variety of ancillary data. The map was reviewed by experts familiar with their particular region, including many of the original authors of the CAVM from Canada, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway (including Svalbard), Russia, and the U.S. The analysis presented here summarizes the area, geographical distribution, elevation, summer temperatures, and NDVI of the map units. The greater spatial resolution of the Raster CAVM allowed more detailed mapping of water-bodies and mountainous areas. It portrays coastal-inland gradients, and better reflects the heterogeneity of vegetation type distribution than the original CAVM. Accuracy assessment of random 1-km pixels interpreted from 6 Landsat scenes showed an average of 70 % accuracy, up from 39 % for the original CAVM. The distribution of shrub-dominated types changed the most, with more prostrate shrub tundra mapped in mountainous areas, and less low shrub tundra in lowland areas. This improved mapping is important for quantifying existing and potential changes to land cover, a key environmental indicator for modeling and monitoring ecosystems.",

    "title": "Macquarie Island Vegetation and Drainage Structure Data Set",
    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "The data for this map were collected as part of two ASAC projects - 488 and 956, of which Patricia Selkirk was the chief investigator. Macquarie Island (54 degrees S 159 degrees E) is a subantarctic island (c. 35km by 3 to 5km) approximately equidistant between Tasmania, New Zealand and Antarctica in the Southern Ocean. The vegetation is herbaceous, lacking shrubs and trees. Vegetation and drainage are mapped at a scale of 1:25 000 from field observations, satellite imagery and limited oblique and aerial photography. The categories adopted for mapping vegetation are based on attributes of foliage height and percentage foliage cover of the ground surface (vegetation structure), not on species distribution (floristics). The distribution of vegetation categories is strongly correlated with aspect, topography and rock type. Mires, streams and lakes form an intricate drainage pattern that is strongly influenced by the geology of this tectonically active emergent crest of the submarine Macquarie Ridge at the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates. The drainage pattern of the whole island is represented in a map with substantially greater accuracy than in any previous map.",
    "detailed_description": "INTRODUCTION\nThe vegetation of Macquarie Island reflects its isolation in the Southern Ocean, low average summer temperature, extremely strong winds, and the island's geology and hydrology. The island, 34km north-south by 2-5km east-west, comprises an undulating plateau bounded by steep coast-facing slopes and cliffs. Drainage on the island is complex and, to date, poorly mapped. The balance between surface and underground flow of water has profound effects on streams, lakes and on the distribution of structural vegetation types.\nIsolation and Flora. At 54° S 159° E Macquarie Island is approximately 1500km south east of Tasmania, 1000km south west of New Zealand. It is one of only seven subantarctic islands or island groups close to the Polar Front in the Southern Ocean. It has never been part of or close to a continental land mass. Its entire flora has arrived by long distance, over-ocean dispersal. The vascular plant flora is small, 46 species (Hnatiuk 1993), and shows strong similarities to the floras of other subantarctic islands, to New Zealand and , less strongly, to Australia (Selkirk et al 1990). Non-vascular plants constitute an important part of the Macquarie Island flora: 83 species of mosses, 51 species of liverworts (Selkirk et al 1990), 141 species of lichens (Kantvilas and Seppelt 1992), at least 400 species of non-marine algae (T.P. McBride pers. comm.).\nLow average summer temperature. Substantial woody growth is commonly found where the average temperature for three summer months exceeds 10° C. In common with other subantarctic islands, summer temperature on Macquarie Island (6.7° C mean 1948-86, Jacka, Christou and Cook 1984) is such that little woody growth is produced. The largest terrestrial plants, the non-woody tussock grass, Poa foliosa and the forb Stilbocarpa polaris, reach about 1.5m tall. Most plants are non woody and shorter than about 0.3m, but three species, Coprosma perpusilla, Acaena magellanica and A. minor, produce woody creeping stems up to about 0.5cm diameter.\nStrong winds. The severe climatic conditions result in a dynamic interaction between plants and landforms. Wind, snow, ice and water produce active erosion even on low slopes. Complex vegetation patterns occur over small distances, for example areas with high percentage of bare ground (feldmark) adjoin areas where the vegetation cover is complete.\nGeology. In the northern third of the island is a large area where the extremely sparse vegetation is explained by the presence of rock types which produce soil unfavourable for plant growth (Adamson et al 1993). Most of the southern two thirds of the island is a thick pile of pillow lavas and pyroclastic rocks whose intense fracturing promotes rapid infiltration of water. Bedding and faulting influence the flow of groundwater. As a result, areas of groundwater intake are generally well drained, while areas of outflow have abundant mires.\nHydrology. Surface and underground flow of water is strongly influenced by geological features. Fault-bounded escarpments frequently control the direction of streams and location of lakes (Ledingham and Peterson 1984). Faults and fractures channel groundwater. Vegetation in lakes includes Myriophyllum triphyllum, various bryophytes, and abundant algae including at least 250 species of diatoms.\nBare ground. On steep slopes between the plateau (altitude 100-400m a.s.l) and the coast, and on the plateau itself, bare ground is common. Strong wind, rain, sleet, and snow cause abrasion of plants and the bare ground. The progressive accumulation of peat, even on gentle slopes, results in mass movement of soil and its vegetation (Selkirk 1996). The resultant scars are subject to accelerated erosion and slow colonisation (Scott 1985).\nNearshore marine vegetation. Offshore, the algal vegetation is dense. Brown algae grow to many metres in length. Southern kelps, particularly the bull kelp, Durvillaea antarctica, from the high tide limit to more than 15m depth, and Macrocystis pyrifera, form impressive masses of floating fronds, particularly prominent along the sheltered eastern coast. The great size of individual marine algal plants contrasts with the short stature of the terrestrial vegetation.\nTHE MAP\nThis map depicts, at a scale of 1:25 000, distribution of structural vegetation categories, with emphasis on height of the vegetation above the ground, and its density, defined as % of the ground surface covered by plants. The map does not show the distribution of species, nor does it attempt to establish and then map plant associations or comparable categories which reflect communities of plant species.\nTaylor (1955) mapped the vegetation of the whole island at small scale (approx. 1:63000, i.e. 1 inch to the mile), and the northern quarter at approx. 1:22000, using four essentially structural categories: wet tussock, subglacial herbfield, feldmark, bare ground. In the text accompanying the map he took a phytosociological approach, dividing the Macquarie Island vegetation into five main formations: grassland, herbfield, fen, bog and feldmark. Within each formation he described one or more alliances, associations and sub-associations. Since his pioneering work some aerial photography and satellite imagery have become available, much additional field work has been done, and a fuller assessment is now possible of environmental controls. Copson (1984) plotted the distribution of vascular plant species for the whole island on a 1 km x 1 km grid, showing the wide distribution of many species.\nIn preparing this map, we have used as a basis the SPOT 3 merged pan/multispectral image of 22 December 1994 and the coastline prepared from this image by AUSLIG. We have consulted the black and white aerial photography of 6 and 7 February 1976, runs CAS 5465, CAS 8467 to 8473 and CAS 8480 to 8483. We have drawn extensively on our fieldwork and on our own and colleagues' field notes and photographs.\nAlthough the present map is more detailed and at a larger scale than previous studies, it is preliminary. Its most important role is as a basis for more detailed work in the future. Detailed work is probably best carried out on carefully selected small areas of the island where mapping and other data gathering can be done at high resolution. Knowledge of the present vegetation is needed to assess the consequences of environmental change including the effects that the planned eradication of cats will have on burrow-nesting bird and rabbit populations, and in turn on vegetation.\nThe topographic map of Macquarie Island (Division of National Mapping 1971) is inaccurate with respect to the drainage system of lakes and streams (Selkirk and Adamson 1995). The map prepared by Blake in 1911-14 (Mawson 1943) is more accurate than the 1971 map. The geological maps of Macquarie Island (Tasmanian Geological Survey 1998) include more detailed representations of drainage than Blake's map or the topographic map. Although less detailed in places than the geological maps, the present map is in our view, more accurate in locating some stream and stream-lake connections. Definitive mapping of streams on Macquarie Island is yet to be done.\nCATEGORIES AND THEIR TERMINOLOGY\nVegetation mapping categories were chosen to indicate foliage density and foliage height, similar to the scheme of Specht (Specht et al 1995), now widely adopted throughout Australia when mapping vegetation structure (AUSLIG 1990). It is appropriate to adopt Specht's boundary of 70% foliage projective cover of the ground in order to establish two categories, closed vegetation (foliage projective cover greater than 70%) and open vegetation (foliage projective cover less than 70%). Field checking showed that the SPOT imagery (22 December 1994) is a valuable aid in delineating boundaries between closed and open vegetation. Vegetation whose foliage stands higher than 0.4 to 0.5m above the ground is designated tall vegetation and it can be distinguished from short vegetation whose foliage is less than 0.4 to 0.5m in height.\nThe term herb is applied to vegetation containing herbaceous , i.e. essentially non-woody, species which includes monocotyledons (such as grasses and graminoids), dicotyledons (such as forbs), and ferns. The terms grass and grassland are not used, first because forbs and graminoids (such as sedges that are not in the grass family) are abundant in almost all areas of short herb vegetation, and second because in places where the tall tussock grass Poa foliosa is dominant it often forms complex mosaics with the large forb Stilbocarpa polaris so that this vegetation is categorised as closed tall herb vegetation, rather than tussock grassland.\n \nThe general term mire is applied to vegetation of waterlogged areas, in preference to the more restrictive terms bog or fen whose correct usage depends upon knowing attributes such as pH.\nEach mapping unit identifies areas which, when examined at greater resolution, prove to be complex mosaics, some features of which are described below.\nVegetation cover 70% or greater (closed vegetation).\nClosed tall herb vegetation, northern and eastern coast. The tall herbs are mainly the tussock grass Poa foliosa and the forb Stilbocarpa polaris but in restricted areas in valleys draining into Sandy Bay and Green Gorge, thickets of the fern Polystichum vestitum also occur. Poa foliosa and S. polaris may occur in almost monospecific stands, but they commonly occur together. The tall vegetation is absent on gentler slopes near the coast where drainage is poor, and on unstable surfaces such as active scree, outwash fans, and crumbling rocky outcrops. Closed tall herb vegetation also occurs on the western and southern steep coast-facing slopes below the plateau, but there it is included in the category 'vegetation on western and southern coast-facing slopes'. The category 'closed tall herb vegetation' covers Taylor's (1955) wet tussock grassland formation.\nClosed short herb vegetation. This vegetation, commonly about 0.2m tall, provides near-complete or complete ground cover over large areas of the island, particularly on the plateau and in valleys that slope gently down towards the coast. This category, which can enclose small mires, also occurs on the eastern coast-facing slopes, particularly below the change of slope noted on the map. The floristic (species) composition is complex. It ranges from extensive stands of Acaena spp. that are almost monospecific to communities made up of most of the vascular species of the island. Sedge-like plants such as Luzula crinita are abundantly and widely distributed in this vegetation category.\nBryophytes make an important contribution to the total ground cover. The category 'closed short herb vegetation' includes most of Taylor's (1955) sub-glacial herbfield formation.\nClosed vegetation on western and northern marine-cut platform. A wide gently sloping wave-cut platform fringes the northern and part of the western coast of the island. It is backed by steep slopes leading up to the plateau and is mantled by a complex mosaic of tall and short herb closed vegetation, mires and lakes. Some areas are dominated by bryophytes. The platform's low slope, with abundant precipitation and drainage from the plateau has led to waterlogging in many parts. The category 'closed vegetation on western and northern marine-cut platform' includes parts of Taylor's (1955) sub-glacial herbfield formation, and parts of his bog and fen formations.\nMire on the plateau. Mire vegetation in permanently saturated areas and infilled lakes is short and covers the ground completely. Bryophytes are frequently dominant. Mires occur in valley bottoms where slope angle is low, but where groundwater emerges they occur on quite steep surfaces in very localised areas. The category 'mire on the plateau' includes parts of Taylor's (1955) bog and fen formations.\nVegetation cover less than 70% (open vegetation).\nOpen short herb vegetation (and northern and eastern gullies). The pattern and proportions of bare ground and vegetation are extremely variable. There is commonly a mosaic of polygonal patches in which both the bare ground and the edges of the vegetated areas are subject to erosion. Also common are alternating stripes of vegetation and bare ground, often in the form of stepped benches or terraces. Bryophytes become dominant or codominant with angiosperms such as Azorella macquariensis in the most exposed places. This category includes the feldmark formation of Taylor (1955), and the sparse vegetation on unfavourable soils (Adamson et al 1993).\nVegetation on western and southern coast-facing slopes. This is a complex interdigitation of tall, short, closed and open vegetation with bluffs, cliffs and large active screes along the steep slopes below the plateau along the western and southern sides of the island. The mixture has been grouped as a complex rather than attempt its subdivision at this stage.\nVegetation cover c.0% (bare ground).\nLarge areas of bare ground devoid of bryophytes and vascular plants occur where penguins establish colonies, and where erosion is particularly active.\n\n\nREFERENCES\nAdamson, D.A., Selkirk, J.M. and Seppelt, R.D. 1993.

    "abstract": "These data were developed for an analysis of the extent to which coastal habitats in the New Zealand Territorial Sea are currently (2010) represented in areas that meet the New Zealand Marine Protected Area Protection Standard.",
    "detailed_description": "In order to map marine habitats consistently across all bioregions, Geographic Information System (GIS) datasets were sourced, where possible, that extended across all of the New Zealand Territorial Sea. The intent was to avoid bias in the representation of habitats associated with differences in the extent and detail of surveys in different regions. The disadvantage of this approach, however, is that the more detailed surveys available or underway in some regions (Neale et al. 2007, WCMPF 2010, Benn 2009; Kettles &amp; Hughes 2009; Kerr 2010, Morrison et al. 2010) are not included in this broad scale analysis. These surveys should be included in more detailed regional assessments. The extent of habitat mapping was mainly defined by the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) coastline, the LINZ boundary (2004) to the New Zealand Territorial Sea (within 12 nautical miles of the coast and islands), estuaries from the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) New Zealand Estuary Environment Classification (Hume 2007) and bioregions defined in the Marine Protected Areas Policy and Implementation Plan (Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries 2005).Within these bioregions, spatial data layers for depth, substrata and exposure were overlaid in ArcGIS to approximate the habitat categories described in the Coastal Classification and Mapping Scheme (Appendix 1, Ministry of Fisheries and Department of Conservation 2008). In some cases, categories were modified according to what data were available and to provide consistent, justifiable, readily interpreted habitat descriptions that adequately reflect major patterns in marine environments. The data sources and habitat categories that were used are described in the report: Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries(2012).&quot;Coastal marine habitats and marine protected areas in the New Zealand Territorial Sea: a broad scale gap analysis. Wellington, New Zealand. More detailed descriptions of source data within the New Zealand Territorial Sea are described in separate coverages for NZ marine bioregions; NZ depth, NZ substrata and NZ exposure. The GIS datasets were combined using the unioncommand in ArcGIS and ArcINFO 9.3. This command overlays and dissects the intersections between overlapping areas from different datasets. The function creates polygon features attributed with fields of variables from each of the source data sets. These fields were used to create composite categories derived from combinations of the different levels in the depth, substrata and exposure fields. The ArcGIS ‘eliminate’ command was used to minimise the large numbers of elongate ‘sliver polygons’ resulting from overlaying disparate datasets. Slivers less than 1 hectare in area were dissolved into the adjacent polygon with the longest joint boundary.Because of the number of small slivers and extent of the data set, boundaries between habitats classes were sometimes generalised resulting in small departures (usually &lt;50m) from the lines of the original habitat data including the coastline. Regard should then be given to the fitness for use of this data for use other than its intended purpose as a broad scale classification and gaps analysis. This should be taken into account particularly for viewing and analysis at fine spatial scales.In some cases, the source datasets did not completely overlap and for some areas a full classification using all environmental drivers was not possible. In most cases the area involved was small and polygons were merged with the nearest feature with the longest joint boundary. For parts of some estuaries, no nationally consistent data on substrata were available. These areas were mapped simply as unclassified estuary. This category was not however included within habitat counts for each bioregion.",

    "detailed_description": "Madagascar est un haut lieu de la biodiversité\nmondiale, hébergeant un certain nombre\nd’espèces et d’écosystèmes endémiques les plus rares\nau monde mais aussi les plus menacés. Or l’évaluation\nde cette biodiversité a toujours été plus ou moins\naxée sur les espèces, et en particulier sur les espèces\nles plus emblématiques. Ainsi, cette application des\ncritères de la Liste rouge des écosystèmes de l’UICN\n(LRE) à l’échelle du pays constitue la première tentative\nd’évaluation de la biodiversité de Madagascar à\nl’échelle des écosystèmes.\nCette évaluation a notamment permis de formaliser\nune typologie d’écosystèmes à l’échelle nationale, qui\nsoit reconnue par l’ensemble des acteurs impliqués.\nCe travail a également permis aux experts impliqués\nde réaliser une large synthèse bibliographique, afin\nde décrire précisément ces écosystèmes terrestres,\nmarins et côtiers selon les prérogatives requises par\nla méthodologie UICN. Mais surtout, l’évaluation de la\ndynamique spatiale de ces écosystèmes fait de cette\ninitiative un exemple probant de mise en œuvre de\nl’outil de connaissance « Liste rouge des écosystèmes\nde l’UICN » à une échelle nationale, et ce malgré le\nmanque de données adaptées à la méthodologie de\ncet outil.\nAinsi, sur les 35 écosystèmes terrestres, côtiers et\nmarins évalués, 16 sont menacés (Vulnérable, En\nDanger ou En Danger Critique) et 16 n’ont pu être\névalués faute de données disponibles. Ce rapport\nprésente les grands principes scientifiques de la Liste\nrouge des écosystèmes de l’UICN et les enjeux relatifs\nà sa déclinaison à une échelle nationale, le contexte\nmalgache et le protocole suivi pour l’application des\nseuils et critères de la méthodologie UICN puis une\nsynthèse des résultats eux-mêmes.\nCes résultats sont d’abord présentés sous la forme\nd’une analyse globale de l’influence humaine sur les\nmilieux naturels de Madagascar et de la dynamique\ndes écosystèmes, puis résumés pour chacun des\nécosystèmes évalués. Cette synthèse est issue des\nfiches d’évaluation réalisées pour chaque écosystème,\nquant à elles disponibles sur le site internet\nwww.iucnrle.org et publiées en Annexe de ce rapport.\nCe travail a été piloté par le Ministère de\nl’Environnement, de l’Ecologie et des Forêts de\nMadagascar et a fortement impliqué le réseau des\nONG locales et internationales, des universitaires du\npays et des responsables et gestionnaires de terrain.\nPour mener ces évaluations, l’Union Internationale\npour la Conservation de la Nature (UICN) a organisé\nplusieurs ateliers à Madagascar afin de constituer et\nde former un comité d’experts évaluateurs capables de\nrassembler les données pertinentes et d’appliquer les\ncritères et seuils de la méthodologie UICN.

    "abstract": "The vegetation classification produced for this atlas includes 10 major physiognomic types (forest, woodland, bushland, thicket, grassland, anthropic and so on) and incorporates 15 mappable vegetation units.",
    "detailed_description": "Madagascar is home to more than 10 000 plant species, 80% of which occur nowhere else in the world. With natural vegetation ranging from rainforest to unique spiny forest, Madagascar’s range of plant diversity makes it one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. In common with many other tropical countries, the flora of Madagascar is extremely threatened not only by habitat destruction for agriculture, fuelwood, building materials and so on, but also, in the case of certain species, by over-collection for the horticultural trade. The CEPF Madagascar Vegetation Mapping Project is a three-year project (2003–2006), funded by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) and managed jointly by The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Missouri Botanical Garden, and Conservation International’s Center for Applied Biodiversity Science. The project is innovative in a number of ways. It employs state-of-the art remote sensing technology and methodologies to delimit Madagascar’s vegetation. It represents an all-inclusive collaboration between specialists from a wide range of botanical and conservation institutions, which has ensured the most thoroughly ground-truthed vegetation map ever compiled for Madagascar. Finally, through a series of workshops, it incorporates detailed consultations with the conservation community to ensure that the final products are of maximum relevance and utility to conservation planners and managers. An accurate and updated vegetation map is imperative for conservation planning and natural resource management in Madagascar. It is also essential that the data on which such a map is based be made freely available, so that conservation organisations, government departments, academic institutions and other stakeholders can use them as an up-to-date standard dataset on which to base their activities. The electronic version of this atlas is available on Kew’s website (www.vegmad.org), and local experts were invited to continually improve and update the map. In order for a vegetation map to fulfil its intended role it must accurately delimit areas with various vegetation types as they currently exist, and assign those areas to objective categories that can be easily recognised in the field and that reliably reflect fundamental biological differences (primarily structural features, for example, physiognomy). Madagascar is becoming increasingly aware of the need to protect its biodiversity. The most immediate use of this vegetation map in conservation is likely to be by protected area managers who wish to understand the flora of their designated areas. It will also provide a valuable baseline for monitoring longer-term changes in vegetation inside and outside protected areas. However, Madagascar also provides an exceptionally high rate of species discovery and description, and this atlas will be used by field biologists attempting to identify potential sampling sites for biodiversity surveys, which will in turn yield data that is critical for biogeographic research and conservation planning. At the 2003 World Parks Congress, Madagascar’s President Marc Ravalomanana emphasised his country’s commitment to conservation by announcing its intent to triple the size of its existing protected area network. This admirable effort to prevent the extinction of many of Madagascar’s endemic species has become known as the ‘Durban Vision’. In order to ensure effective preservation of Madagascar’s biodiversity, the identification of sites for these new protected areas should follow a systematic process. A recent workshop on systematic conservation planning (November 2005, Antananarivo) highlighted the importance of using habitat types and indicators of habitat quality in addition to species distribution data when conducting conservation prioritisation analyses, concluding that this is the best way to produce robust conservation solutions. Because only a small proportion of Madagascar’s species have had their distributions documented, the vegetation types identified by this mapping project are good surrogates for habitat diversity and for the majority of the biota, which is so little known. In addition, conservation practitioners, including NGOs and donors, need information on trends in natural vegetation cover and quality in order to assess the outcomes of their conservation work. The Convention on Biological Diversity includes trends in the extent of habitats among its headline indicators for tracking progress towards the 2010 target (SBSTTA, 2004). The immediate focus of the Durban Vision group will be on establishing new protected areas (map 1) in remaining native vegetation, although subsequent attention could productively turn to managing that vegetation, and the habitat quality categories in the atlas provide valuable information. The atlas also provides important up-to-date information on native vegetation cover and quality, which maximises its potential to aid planning for future habitat restoration activities.",

    "title": "Remnant 2021 broad vegetation groups - Queensland",
    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "The State of Queensland in northeast Australia covers 1.73 million square kilometres and encompasses a wide variety of landscapes across temperate, wet and dry tropics and semiarid to arid climatic zones. Currently (April 2023), 1435 regional ecosystems are recognised across Queensland. Regional ecosystems are defined and mapped at 1:100,000 scale across the state. Many regional ecosystems include one or more vegetation communities, some of which are only recognised and mapped at scales larger than 1:100,000. A vegetation community is an association within a regional ecosystem that has similar structure and floristics and occurs within the same land zone. Broad Vegetation Groups (BVGs) are a higher-level grouping of vegetation communities and regional ecosystems. \n\nBVGs provide an overview of vegetation across the state or a bioregion. They are a useful addition to the regional ecosystem framework by providing an overview of major ecological patterns and relationships across Queensland, independent of bioregions and land zones, and facilitate comparisons with vegetation in other states and internationally. The primary aim of this document is to concisely describe the BVGs of Queensland to enhance their use in government planning, policy and regulation, e.g., vegetation offsets, Bushfire Hazard Area mapping, public education and scientific investigations. Floristic, structural, functional, biogeographic and landscape attributes have all been used in the BVG classification. The first aggregation of BVGs in the hierarchical classification is determined on the basis of vegetation structure (cover, height and growth form) of the ecologically dominant layer. BVGs are ordered broadly to reflect the vegetation structure along a mesic gradient from wet closed forests (rainforests) of the coast and north east, to the arid spinifex hummock grasslands of the south west.",
    "detailed_description": "Specialised habitats such as freshwater wetlands (BVG 34) and intertidal areas (BVG 35) form the final groups. The rainforest aggregation (BVGs 1-7) is characterised by a generally closed tree canopy, predominantly non-sclerophyllous plants and frequently specialised lifeforms. The large aggregation of BVGs dominated by eucalypts (BVGs 8-19) is further subdivided on the basis of structure, mesic situation, landscape situation, predominant geology and dominant/ diagnostic species. The third aggregation of BVGs is dominated by trees or tall shrubs that are not eucalypts or rainforest species. Some BVGs in this aggregation are generally dominated by a single species, e.g., Melaleuca viridiflora (BVG 21a), or a group of taxonomically and functionally related species, e.g. Acacia cambagei/ A. georginae/ A. argyrodendron (BVG 26a), or by a combination of a structural formation, habitat and functionally related species such as low open woodlands on sand plains (BVG 27b). The final aggregation of BVGs is those not dominated by trees or tall shrubs. Some BVGs in this aggregation encompass vegetation types that are generally dominated by a suite of taxonomically and functionally related species, such as Acacia spp. on residuals (BVG 24a) or Senna spp. (e.g., BVG 24b). Other groups are dominated by a distinct structural formation (such as tussock and closed tussock grasslands BVGs 30-32). The Vegetation of Queensland describes the 98 BVGs defined for the 1:1M mapping level and lists the most extensive regional ecosystems in each BVG. The document is illustrated with 375 photographs, 108 tables and 103 maps, with detailed pre-clearing and remnant extent, and extent within the protected area estate. There are three nested levels of BVG which reflect the approximate scale at which they are designed to be used: the 1:1,000,000 (regional) (98 BVGs), 1:2,000,000 (state) (35 BVGs) and 1:5,000,000 (national) (16 BVGs).

    "title": "Allen Coral Atlas",
    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "The Allen Coral Atlas is built by a dedicated team of scientists, technologists, and conservationists, using one-of-a-kind methodologies. The Allen Coral Atlas was conceived and funded by the late Paul Allen’s Vulcan Inc. and is managed by the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science. Along with partners from Planet, the Coral Reef Alliance, and the University of Queensland, the Atlas utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced analytics to map and monitor the world’s coral reefs in unprecedented detail. The partnership together identified the following methods for habitat map creation, dynamic monitoring, and other related coral reef products. \n\nAs part of the Allen Coral Atlas’s revisions to its habitat maps in 2022, a new reef extent product was generated for each mapping region. In context of this product, reef extent is defined as the location of shallow coral reef features that can generally be seen from satellites. It typically excludes areas of very deep and very turbid water. This is intended to provide a more generalized and inclusive layer that depicts the extent of the coral reef environment which is additional to the Atlas’ geomorphic zonation maps. The reef extent data product can be seen as a single layer on the Atlas and compared and analyzed alongside other datasets such as reef habitat maps and reef threat monitoring datasets. \n\nThe underlying reef extent product is a raster at 5m pixel resolution, matching the geomorphic and benthic map products. The raster combines three sources:\n\n1. The extent of the Allen Coral Atlas’s 12 geomorphic zones\n\n2. The extent of our own machine learning-based coral reef habitat layer, originally developed for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network’s 2020 Report on the Status of Coral Reefs of the World\n\n3. A third extent layer that: Filled in holes greater than 400 pixels (0.64Ha) and applied a morphological filter (circle kernel of 5 pixels; 25m) to smooth the reef boundaries and regain missing slope/beach features..\n\nFor the purposes of the data product made visible on the Allen Coral Atlas, these three sources are combined into one single-colored layer.\n\nThe reef extent layer more inclusively depicts the shallow coral reef environment than our more detailed benthic or geomorphic habitat maps. It includes reef features that were unmappable to geomorphic/benthic level, including deeper reef structures, reef habitat in more turbid water, deep or very steep reef slope areas, and very shallow intertidal areas at the land-sea interface. Known limitations are that some areas of supra-tidal beach and vegetation are included, which may not strictly be coral reef environments. Overall, the reef extent product is still conservative, and we expect that the area of reef erroneously included at the land-sea interface is greatly outweighed by the areas of reef still missed at both the shallow and deep margins of the product.",
    "detailed_description": "The six Allen Coral Atlas Global Benthic Habitat Map classes were developed by Roelfsema et al 2013* with input from other coral reef benthic classifications. This classification maximizes the breadth of information available from Planet Dove remote sensing data to create the best set of classes we can to support users. Benthic classification for global scale reef mapping is still constrained by spatial resolution, quality and accessibility of biophysical earth observation data. The satellites we use are still fundamentally unable to distinguish some of the key measures that ecologists prefer to assess reef health (e.g., cover of living coral, cover of dead coral, cover of bleached corals and functional forms of algae) but broad classes like Coral Habitat and Rubble can still be informative for characterising the local ecology.",

    "abstract": "This study has used L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) global mosaic datasets from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for 11 epochs from 1996 to 2020 to develop a long-term time-series of global mangrove extent and change. The study used a map-to-image approach to change detection where the baseline map (GMW v2.5) was updated using thresholding and a contextual mangrove change mask. This approach was applied between all image-date pairs producing 10 maps for each epoch, which were summarised to produce the global mangrove time-series. The resulting mangrove extent maps had an estimated accuracy of 87.4 % (95th conf. int.: 86.2 - 88.6 %), although the accuracies of the individual gain and loss change classes were lower at 58.1 % (52.4 - 63.9 %) and 60.6 % (56.1 - 64.8 %), respectively. Sources of error included a mis-registration in the SAR mosaic datasets, which could only be partially corrected for, but also confusion in fragmented areas of mangroves, such as around aquaculture ponds. Overall, 152,604 km2 (133,996 - 176,910) of mangroves were identified for 1996, with this decreasing by -5,245 km2 (-13,587 - 3686) resulting in a total extent of 147,359 km2 (127,925 - 168,895) in 2020, and representing an estimated loss of 3.4 % over the 24-year time period.

    "detailed_description": "Mangroves are a globally important ecosystem that provides a wide range of ecosystem system services, such as carbon capture and storage, coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Mangroves have significantly reduced in global extent over the last 50 years, primarily as a result of deforestation caused by the expansion of agriculture and aquaculture in coastal environments. However, a limited number of studies have attempted to estimate changes in global mangrove extent, particularly into the 1990s, despite much of the loss in mangrove extent occurring pre-2000.

Each pixel was classified into tidal flat, permanent water or other with reference to a globally distributed set of training data. This product depicts tidal flat ecosystems around the global coastline. Pixels classified as tidal flat in the analysis represent several types of tidal flat ecosystems, including unconsolidated fine-grain sediments (tidal mudflats), unconsolidated coarse-grain sediments (tidal sand flats), and consolidated sediments, organic material or rocks (wide tidal rock-platforms), while excluding spectral signatures indicating the presence of vegetation dominated intertidal ecosystems such as mangroves and vegetated marshes. The analysis aimed to identify pixels that are subject to regular tidal inundation, and therefore may also include other intertidal systems where intertidal dynamics are observable.",

    "abstract": "Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international initiative with the goal of repeatedly surveying the world's estimated 200,000 glaciers. GLIMS uses data collected by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard the Terra satellite and the LANDSAT series of satellites, along with historical observations. The GLIMS initiative has created a unique glacier inventory, storing information about the extent and rates of change of all the world's mountain glaciers and ice caps. The GLIMS Glacier Database was built up from data contributions from many glaciological institutions, which are managed by Regional Coordinators, who coordinate the production of glacier mapping results for their particular region. The GLIMS Glacier Database provides students, educators, scientists, and the public with reliable glacier data from these analyses. New glacier data are continually being added to the database. The GLIMS Glacier Viewer was developed to provide the public with easy access to the GLIMS Glacier Database. This Web application allows users to view and query several thematic layers, including glacier outlines, Regional Coordinator institution locations, the World Glacier Inventory, and more. GLIMS data can be downloaded into a number of GIS-compatible formats, including ESRI Shapefiles, MapInfo tables, Geographic Mark-up Language (GML), and Keyhole Mark-up Language (KML) suitable for viewing in Google Earth.",

To better understand the global distribution and changes in tidal marsh extent, and identify opportunities for their conservation and restoration, it is critical to develop a spatial knowledge base of their global occurrence. \n\nHere, we develop a globally consistent tidal marsh distribution map for the year 2020 at 10-m resolution. To map the location of the world’s tidal marshes we applied a random forest classification model to earth observation data from the year 2020. We trained the classification model with a reference dataset developed to support distribution mapping of coastal ecosystems, and predicted the spatial distribution of tidal marshes between 60°N to 60°S. We validated the tidal marsh map using standard accuracy assessment methods, with our final map having an overall accuracy score of 0.852. We estimate the global extent of tidal marshes in 2020 to be 52,880 km2 (95% CI: 32,030 to 59,780 km2) distributed across 120 countries and territories. Tidal marsh distribution is centred in temperate and Arctic regions, with nearly half of the global extent of tidal marshes occurring in the temperate Northern Atlantic (45%) region. At the national scale, over a third of the global extent (18,510 km2; CI: 11,200 – 20,900) occurs within the USA.

    "abstract": "The EC JRC global map of forest cover provides a spatially explicit representation of forest presence and absence for the year 2020 at 10m spatial resolution. \n\nThe year 2020 corresponds to the cut-off date of the Regulation from the European Union \"on the making available on the Union market and the export from the Union of certain commodities and products associated with deforestation and forest degradation\" (EUDR, Regulation (EU) 2023/1115). In the context of the EUDR, the global forest cover map can be used as a non-mandatory, non-exclusive, and not legally binding source of information. Further information about the map and its use can be found on the EU Observatory on Deforestation and Forest Degradation (EUFO) in the section on Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nForest means land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, excluding land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Agricultural use means the use of land for the purpose of agriculture, including for agricultural plantations (i.e. tree stands in agricultural production systems such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems) and set- aside agricultural areas, and for rearing livestock. All plantations of relevant commodities other than wood, that is cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya, are excluded from the forest definition. The global map of forest cover was created by combining available global datasets (wall-to-wall or global in their scope) on tree cover, tree height, land cover and land use into a single harmonized globally-consistent representation of where forests existed in 2020.",
    "detailed_description": "The workflow consisted in first mapping the global maximum extent of tree cover circa the year 2020 from the combination of ESA World Cover 2020 and 2021, WRI Tropical Tree Cover 2020, UMD Global land cover and land use 2019, Global Mangrove Watch 2020, and JRC Tropical Moist Forest 2020 datasets. In the second step, a series of overlays and decision rules were applied to reduce this maximum extent of tree cover and align it with the Forest definition using datasets covering cropland and commodity expansion (ESA World Cereal, UMD Global land cover and land use 2019, UMD Global Cropland Expansion, High-resolution global map of smallholder and industrial oil palm plantations, and WRI Spatial Database of Planted Trees), land use change (UMD global forest cover loss, JRC Tropical Moist Forest, IIASA Global Forest Management), built-up (JRC Global Human Settlement), and water (JRC Global Surface Water).\n\nThe detailed mapping approach will be described in a separate technical report expected to be released by March 2024.

    "abstract": "The Spatial Database of Planted Trees (SDPT) was compiled by Global Forest Watch using data obtained from national governments, non-governmental organizations and independent researchers. Data were compiled for 82 countries around the world, with most country maps originating from supervised classification or manual polygon delineation of Landsat, SPOT or RapidEye satellite imagery.\n\nThe category of “planted trees” in the SDPT includes forest plantations of native or introduced species, established through deliberate human planting or seeding. Sometimes called “tree farms,” these forests infuse the global economy with a constant stream of lumber for construction, pulp for paper and fuelwood for energy. The data set also includes agricultural tree crops like oil palm plantations, avocado farms, apple orchards and even Christmas tree farms. The SDPT makes it possible to identify planted forests and tree crops as being separate from natural forests and enables changes in these planted areas to be monitored independently from changes in global natural forest cover.\n\nThe SDPT contains 173 million hectares of planted forest and 50 million hectares of agricultural trees, or approximately 82% of the world’s total planted forest area in 2015 (FAO 2015). The SDPT was compiled through a procedure that included cleaning and processing each individual data set before creating a harmonized attribute table.\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the Technical Note.\nData is available for download in all countries except China and Papua New Guinea.",

    "abstract": "This data set was created by Transparent World, with the support of Global Forest Watch. Many studies depicting forest cover and forest change cannot distinguish between natural forests and plantations. This data set attempts to distinguish tree plantations from natural forest for seven key countries: Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Liberia, Malaysia, and Peru.\n\nGiven the variability of plantations and their spectral similarity to natural forests, this study used visual interpretations of satellite imagery, primarily Landsat, supplemented by high resolution imagery (Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Digital Globe), where available, to locate plantations. Analysts hand-digitized plantation boundaries based on several key visual criteria, including texture, shape, color, and size.\n\nEach polygon is labelled with the plantation type and when possible, the species. A “gr” in front of the species name indicates a group of species, such as pines or fruit, where the individual species was not identifiable. The percentage of plantation coverage indicates a rough estimate of the prevalence of plantation within apolygon (as in the case of a mosaic). Types are defined as follows:* Large industrial plantation: single plantation units larger than 100 hectares* Mosaic of medium-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 100 hectares embedded within patches of other land use* Mosaic of small-sized plantations: mosaic of plantation units < 10 hectares embedded within patches of other land use.* Clearing/ very young plantation: bare ground with contextual clues suggesting it will become a plantations (shape or pattern of clearing, proximity to other plantations, distinctive road network, etc)For more information on this data set and how it was produced, see the forthcoming WRI Technical Note associated with this project.",

When overlayed with other global or local climate and socio-economic data, the dataset can be used to evaluate the social and ecological benefits and costs from plantations, such as the carbon sequestration from planted forests. Because this dataset contains information on the tree species, it can also help with the prediction of yield from tree crops and the demand for water. Our code to map planting years can be reused on other similar plantation datasets, such as a new version of the SDPT, which may be released in the future. However, parameter settings for LandTrendr in this study were determined based on the previous research and the testing results for NBR time series of the plantations. When applying this method to other vegetation restoration detections, such as the natural restoration of forests, these parameters may need to be adjusted. In addition, users should be aware of the strips in the dataset which are caused by the banding problem in Landsat ETM + images.",
    "detailed_description": "The dataset has a spatial resolution of 30 m. It is in a GeoTIFF format and has three bands named \"plantyear\" ,\"startyear\" and \"species\", which describe the planting years and the species of trees, and the year in which Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI data began to accumulate. The \"startyear\" band should be used as the Quality Assessment (QA) band for this dataset because the supplementary value from 1982 to the start year may contain erroneous LandTrendr estimates of planting years.\n\nThe values of the three bands range from 1981 to 2019, 0 to 2020 and 1 to 190, respectively. For the \"plantyear\" band, a value of 1981 means the planting year was before 1982, and values from 1982 to 2019 correspond to the planting years. A value of 0 in the \"startyear\" band indicates that no Landsat data from June to September was obtained for the pixel during the period 1982–2020. Values from 1 to 1981 are not present and values 1982–2020 show the year when Landsat data started to accumulate. Values 1–190 in the \"species\" band represent tree species provided by the SDPT.",

    "abstract": "More than one-third of Earth’s landmass is drained by rivers that seasonally freeze over. Ice transforms the hydrologic, ecologic, climatic and socio-economic functions of river corridors. Although river ice extent has been shown to be declining in many regions of the world, the seasonality, historical change and predicted future changes in river ice extent and duration have not yet been quantified globally. Previous studies of river ice, which suggested that declines in extent and duration could be attributed to warming temperatures were based on data from sparse locations. Furthermore, existing projections of future ice extent are based solely on the location of the 0-°C isotherm. Here, using satellite observations, we show that the global extent of river ice is declining, and we project a mean decrease in seasonal ice duration of 6.10 ± 0.08 days per 1-°C increase in global mean surface air temperature. We tracked the extent of river ice using over 400,000 clear-sky Landsat images spanning 1984–2018 and observed a mean decline of 2.5 percentage points globally in the past three decades. To project future changes in river ice extent, we developed an observationally calibrated and validated model, based on temperature and season, which reduced the mean bias by 87 per cent compared with the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm approach. We applied this model to future climate projections for 2080–2100: compared with 2009–2029, the average river ice duration declines by 16.7 days under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, whereas under RCP 4.5 it declines on average by 7.3 days. Our results show that, globally, river ice is measurably declining and will continue to decline linearly with projected increases in surface air temperature towards the end of this century.",

Cropland defined as land used for annual and perennial herbaceous crops for human consumption, forage (including hay), and biofuel. Perennial woody crops, permanent pastures, and shifting cultivation are excluded from the definition. The fallow length is limited to four years for the cropland class. The cropland mapping was done using the consistently processed Landsat satellite data archive from 2000 to 2019. The Landsat time-series data were transformed into multitemporal metrics that described land surface phenology. These metrics were used as independent variables for a machine learning classification to map global croplands extent. The classification models were locally calibrated using extensive training data collected by visual interpretation of freely available high spatial resolution remotely sensed data. The crop mapping was performed in four-year intervals (2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2011, 2012-2015, and 2016-2019).

    "detailed_description": "In the present study, we present a global cropland extent and change dataset that can contribute to monitoring national and global progress towards SDGs. We define cropland as land used for annual and perennial herbaceous crops for human consumption, forage (including hay) and biofuel. Perennial woody crops, permanent pastures and shifting cultivation are excluded from the definition. The fallow length is limited to 4 years for the cropland class. Our definition is largely consistent with the arable land category reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN18. To create the cropland dataset, we utilized the consistently processed 30 m spatial resolution Landsat satellite data archive19 from 2000 to 2019. The Landsat time-series data were transformed into multitemporal metrics that characterize land surface phenology. These metrics were used as independent variables for a machine-learning classification to map global cropland extent. The classification models were locally calibrated using extensive training data collected by visual interpretation of freely available, high-spatial-resolution satellite images. We used a probability sample, stratified based on the Landsat-based global cropland maps, to estimate cropland area and its associated uncertainty, and to analyse pathways of land-use conversion. Sample reference data were collected through visual interpretation of Landsat time-series data and higher-spatial-resolution satellite images. Cropland maps were integrated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived annual net primary production (NPP)20 as a proxy variable for analysing crop productivity. The analysis was performed in 4-year epochs (2000–2003, 2004–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2015 and 2016–2019). We created one cropland map per epoch (five maps in total), hereafter referred to by the last year of the interval (for example, the 2019 map represents the 2016–2019 epoch).",

Specifically, we make full use of our prior globally distributed wetland training sample pool, and adopt the local adaptive classification and spatiotemporal consistency checking algorithm to generate annual wetland maps. The GWL_FCS30D maps were found to achieve an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 86.95 ± 0.44% and 0.822, respectively, in 2020, and show great temporal variability in the United States and the European Union.

The mapping approach recalled the earlier rationale, i.e. that current and potential vegetation are valuable proxies for outlining ecosystems, but basic information on land cover and characterization of types have been updated. Additionally, a detailed description of the mapping procedure is provided that may facilitate replication in time, validation processes and comparison with different maps. The crosswalk between the Italian ecosystem typology and other classification systems, already available for Corine Land Cover and EUNIS habitats, was therefore revised and complemented with respect to the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology.

Only general focus maps have been compiled for the habitat types that are missing from this spatial data set, which can be found in the online service of the Red Book of Nature Types by habitat type.\n\nThe data includes the presence of habitat types in a 10 km x 10 km grid. In the data, the occurrence of habitat types is described in five categories: 0 = does not occur, 1 = occurs, 2 = fell area separately, 3 = certain, 4 = possible.\n\nThe material is divided into six different files according to the main groups of natural habitats: LuTUItameri (Baltic Sea), LuTUKalliotKivikot (Rocks and boulders), LuTUMetsat (Forests), LuTUIsavedetRannat (Inland waters and Beaches), LuTUSuot (Marshes) and LuTUTtunturi (Hills).",

    "abstract": "In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped five major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classification levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratified random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture fields. We also identified that 86 Mha of the converted native vegetation was undergoing some level of regrowth. Several applications of the MapBiomas dataset are underway, suggesting that reconstructing historical land use and land cover change maps is useful for advancing the science and to guide social, economic and environmental policy decision-making processes in Brazil.",
    "detailed_description": "It all starts with images from the Landsat satellite, with a resolution of 30 meters, available free of charge on the Google Earth Engine platform and with a time series of more than 30 years. It takes 380 Landsat images to cover Brazil, each one with tens of millions of pixels: in total, there are more than 9 billion pixels measuring 30 x 30 meters to cover the entire country. These pixels are the working units of MapBiomas. Images may contain clouds, smoke and other artifacts that can “dirty” them. To produce a clean image, cloud-free pixels are selected from the images available for the selected period. For each of these pixels, metrics are extracted that explain the behavior of the pixel in that year. This is done for each of the satellite's 7 spectral bands as well as for the calculated fractions and spectral indices. For example, for Band 1, the median of the band values ​​in the period, the maximum value, the minimum value and the range of variation are collected. In the end, each pixel carries up to 105 layers of information for a year.\n\nFor each year, a mosaic is created that covers Brazil, representing the behavior of each pixel through 105 metrics or layers of information. This set of tiles is saved as an Asset within the Google Earth Engine platform. These mosaics will be used in two main ways. First as a source of parameters for the algorithm to classify the images (see next step). It is also from this mosaic that the RGB composition comes out that allows you to view the background image on the MapBiomas platform. This composition is also used for collecting training samples and evaluating accuracy by visual interpretation.\n\nFrom the image mosaics, the teams from each biome and each transversal theme produce a map of each class of land cover and use (forest, countryside, agriculture, pasture, urban area, water, etc.). To do this, MapBiomas analysts use an automatic classifier called “random forest”, which runs on Google's processor cloud. This system is based on machine learning: for each topic to be classified, the machines are “trained” with samples of the targets to be classified. These samples are obtained through reference maps, generation of stable class maps from previous MapBiomas series and direct collection through visual interpretation of Landsat images. The classification is made for each year of the series, and can be saved as a single map per class where each pixel has a number of layers corresponding to the number of years in the historical series analyzed.\n\nThe spatial filter aims to increase the spatial consistency of the data, eliminating isolated or edge pixels. Neighborhood rules are defined that can lead to changes in the pixel classification. For example, a pixel that has less than two of its nine neighboring pixels in the same class will be reclassified to the predominant class in the neighborhood. Each pixel in each year and for each use class goes through this spatial filtering process.\n\nTo reduce temporal inconsistencies, in particular impossible or not permitted changes in coverage and use (e.g. Natural Forest > Non-Forest > Natural Forest) and correct failures due to excess cloud or lack of data, temporal filter rules are applied. For each biome, theme or region, there may be specific temporal filter rules. In total, in Collection 8, more than a hundred rules were applied. The temporal filter is applied to each pixel analyzing all years of the Collection (e.g. Collection 8 was 38 years).\n\nAt this stage, the maps of each class are integrated into a single map, which represents the coverage and land use of the entire territory for each year. Prevalence rules are applied: thus, if the same pixel is classified into two maps of different classes, it is possible to define which one it belongs to in the final map. Prevalence rules may vary according to the peculiarities of biomes, themes or regions. The integration is done for each year of the series and generates an integrated map for each year, generally saved as a single ASSET with the number of annual layers for the analyzed period. The integrated map goes through another spatial filtering step to clean up edges and loose pixels as a result of the integration process.\n\nTo understand changes in land cover and use, maps are produced with class transitions between different pairs of selected years. This way it is possible to visualize the dynamism of the territory, and answer questions such as how much of the forest became pasture from one year to the next, for example, among other changes in the landscape. Transition maps are produced pixel by pixel and, once finalized, they also go through a spatial filter to eliminate isolated transition or edge pixels. From these maps, transition matrices are constructed for each biome, state, municipality and other territorial sections available on the MapBiomas platform.",

    "abstract": "To develop a map of the ecosystems of Mozambique, we used a supervised and expert delineated approach, although this approach was broken up into three phases, where in phase 1 there was a reliance upon machine learning algorithms to allocate all areas to one of the proposed initial vegetation types. The naming and initial classification hierarchy was based on a strict vegetation classification.\n\nThe ecosystem map was therefore based on the vegetation classes, and when cross-walked with the IUCN Typology, resulted in 162 ecosystems, which resulted in 6 realms (level 1), 8 biomes (level 2), 15 functional ecosystem types (level 3), 32 regional ecosystems (level 4), and 162 ecosystems (level 5).\n\nFor the purposes of the Global Ecosystems Atlas, anthropogenic areas obtained from the Mozambique land cover map were overlayed and masked out so that the map can represent current extent.",
    "detailed_description": "Principles informing the development of the vegetation map The first step was to define the general principles to be followed to develop the new ecosystem map:\n• Establish a working group of national and international experts who could support the development of the map;\n• Build on the strengths of existing vegetation maps, such as Wild & Barbosa (1967) and Pedro & Barbosa (1955), by maintaining those vegetation unit concepts that are supported by more recent field information;\n• Build on the field knowledge and experience of the authors of the recently published book on the trees of Mozambique, and regional and national specialists, in splitting, merging or creating new ecosystem units;\n• Endeavour to map the historical extent of vegetation types as best as possible so as to be able assess loss of ecosystems. To do so the authors considered the historic vegetation maps as well as the earliest suitable Landsat 1-3 imagery (1972-1983);\n• Consider edge-matching with adjacent and more recent vegetation maps from surrounding countries to create a more cohesive vegetation map for the broader region\n• To map at a scale of 1: 250 000 or finer so that resulting ecosystems can be used in fine-scaled conservation planning and offset projects;\n• Utilise existing species datasets by collating all available georeferenced plant species distribution records to infer or visualise local vegetation communities in poorly-known areas;\n• Utilise new GIS technologies, such as Random Forest, and available GIS datasets to classify poorly known areas;\n• Validate the resulting map and vegetation unit names by national specialists through a process of comments, workshops and meetings;\n• Update the map and vegetation unit names. Phase 1: Supervised classification of expert identified vegetation units.\nThe purpose of Phase 1 was to create a draft vegetation map for the entire Mozambique that would then serve as the basis for a more thorough review (Phases 2 and 3).",

    "abstract": "The following set of data corresponds to the Map of Potential Ecosystems of Colombia, which is a model of the possible current distribution of ecosystems if human intervention and transformation processes had not existed. For this, the current climate and substrate conditions were assumed. The main inputs used for the delimitation of the ecosystems were aspects related to climate, relief, soils, hydrology and vegetation. In this way, the representation and characterization of ecosystems was made based on the material expression of the ecological processes visible in the geoform and vegetation cover, since most of the distribution of species and ecological processes are related to these patterns.\n\nThe database \"EcosistemasPotencialesDeColombia.gdb\" is made up of 1 feature dataset identified as \"Ecosistemas_potenciales\" and a raster layer called \"eco_ori_30m\". The feature dataset is made up of a feature class called \"Ecosis_Potenciales_Colombia100k\", this layer is the result of the application of a conceptual and methodological model for the delimitation of ecological units, based on explanatory biophysical variables. It includes a validation of the units based on a \"decision tree\" type model. The scale of the layer is 1:100,000 and consists of 81 polygons, which are the number of Potential Ecosystems of Colombia (54 correspond to forest ecosystems, 6 to shrub ecosystems, 16 to ecosystems with a herbaceous stratum domain (savannahs or moors). and 5 to swamp ecosystems with herbaceous vegetation and open water.). Each of the 81 polygons is associated with a unique identifier located in the \"COD\" field, likewise the \"Bio_COD\" field summarizes the classification of the ecosystem with the acronym of the biome to which it belongs and the letter-number code that differentiates it from others. The classification of each ecosystem includes the type of Biome to which it belongs, the Physionomy that refers to the type of physiognomic-ecological unit that describes the ecosystem, the Landscape that is related to the geoform characteristics of the ecosystem and the Region of Colombia where the ecosystem has representativeness.\n\nIn general terms, the ecosystems are grouped within four large biomes at the national level: Zonobiome of Tropical Humid Forests, Zono-Ecotone of Tropical Sub-Humid Forests, Zonobiome of Tropical Dry Forests and Zonobiome of Tropical Deserts.\n\nFor more information regarding the process carried out to generate the \"Potential Ecosystems of Colombia\" layer, refer to the document \"FINAL REPORT LRE_ 2017\" that is compressed along with the data.",

    "abstract": "Forest Survey of India assess the forest cover mapping of the country on a two-year cycle using satellite data. The main objective is presentation of the information on forest resources of the country at state and district level and to prepare forest cover maps on 1:50,000 scale. First assessment of forest cover of the country was made in 1987 and thereafter eight more assessments have been made. District wise information on forest cover has been made available from the third assessment (i.e. from 1991) onwards.\n\nTill the fourth assessment interpretation of data for the entire country had been done visually. During fifth and sixth assessment interpretation of data for Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra which comprises 28% forest cover of the country had been done digitally and for rest of the States/UTs, it had been done visually. In seventh assessment interpretation has been done digitally for thirteen states namely; Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Delhi (UT), Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, which comprises 63% of the forest cover of the country. By eighth assessment the entire country was covered by digital assessment.\n\nThe forest cover is broadly classified in 4 classes, namely very dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest and mangrove. The classification of the cover into dense and open forests is based on internationally adopted norms of classification. It has not been possible to further segregate the dense forest into more classes owing to enormity of work of ground validation and limitations of methodology. Mangroves have been separately classified because of their characteristic tone and texture and unique ecological functions.",

The major objectives of the project are to generate a current status of existing (2206-07) wetlands and geo-database of National wetlands (1:50k scales and area >= 2.25 ha) using Resourcesat-2/2A, LISS-III sensor data of 2017-18. The project has followed similar methodology as used in the case of earlier 2006-07 inventory. A wetland classification system based on IUCN/RAMSAR definition and amenability on remotely sensed data is used to categorise the wetlands. The wetland classification categorises inland and coastal at level-I followed by natural and man-made wetlands as level-II, which were further categorised using a hierarchical system into 20 types of wetlands as level-III classes, excludes rice fields. Each wetland type also exhibit a wide diversity in terms of shape, size, distribution, water quality etc., which are well captured on the satellite imagery. The methodology to create the wetland database is adhered to NWIA technical guidelines manual (Garg and Patel, 2007). Wetlands inventory of 2006-07 (for wetlands area >= 2.25 ha) was updated for interpretational changes by using time series google images and ground information, after that updated figures of wetland number and area have been estimated.",

The LULC maps are generated using multi-temporal satellite data of IRS AWiFS sensor for year 2017-18.\n\nThe data was classified following a hybrid approach (Decision Tree - See5 or Supervised MXL or both). The selection of a classifier is dependent on the number of temporal datasets available during the season, freedom from cloud/haze, complexity of the terrain and temporal registration errors etc., The classification procedure followed is as per the guidelines given in LULC manual. In North Eastern states, Jammu & Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka the required temporal registration was found to be a limiting factor due to complexity of the terrain. In these states the cropped areas were extracted using the individual months and combined with the other LULC information.\n\nThe accuracy was assessed at state level (India administrative unit).Stratified random points generated were used to assess the accuracy of classification. The number of sample points for each strata for selected based on the proportion of the area. However, a minimum of 20 sample points were considered for each class to estimate the accuracy of the classified output. Ground truth data, legacy maps, and multi-temporal FCC have formed the basis for assessment and generation of Kappa co-efficients. The overall classification accuracy is found to be 90.07 % with a range of 86 to 95 % in different states.\n\nFor products covered in the plain terrains second order polynomial method was used and accuracy of one pixel was achieved. In the products of hilly terrains, TIN based model was used against an Area of Interest (AOI). By this method an accuracy of 2-3 pixels is achieved in hilly terrain.",

In response to this need, the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) has generated a 30 m land cover map of Canada for the years 2010, 2015 as well as this 2020 land cover map. This land cover dataset is also the Canadian contribution to the 30 m spatial resolution 2020 Land Cover Map of North America, which is produced by Mexican, American and Canadian government institutions under a collaboration called the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS). This land cover dataset for Canada is produced using observation from Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat sensor.

    "abstract": "This map of North American land cover provides a harmonized view of the physical cover of Earth’s surface across the continent at a spatial resolution of 30 meters, based on Landsat satellite imagery for Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Land Cover classes can include natural features such as tropical forest, shrubland, grassland, water bodies, and bare land, but also human-made features such as asphalt cover and cropland. Nineteen land cover classes were defined, using the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) standard developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.",
    "detailed_description": "The 2020 North American Land Cover 30-meter dataset was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between Natural Resources Canada, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries.\n\nThe general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each country’s specific requirements.  \n\nThis 30-meter dataset of North American Land Cover reflects land cover information for 2020 from Mexico and Canada, 2019 over the conterminous United States and 2021 over Alaska. Each country developed its own classification method to identify Land Cover classes and then provided an input layer to produce a continental Land Cover map across North America. Canada, Mexico, and the United States developed their own 30-meter land cover products; see specific sections on data generation below.\n\nThe main inputs for image classification were 30-meter Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 1 data in the three countries (Canada, the United States and Mexico). Image selection processes and reduction to specific spectral bands varied among the countries due to study-site-specific requirements. While Canada selected most images from the year 2020 with a few from 2019 and 2021, the Conterminous United States employed mainly images from 2019, while Alaska land cover maps are mainly based on the use of images from 2021. The land cover map for Mexico was based on land cover change detection between 2015 and 2020 Mexico Landsat 8 mosaics.\n\nIn order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by CONABIO, INEGI, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country chose their own approaches, ancillary data, and land cover mapping methodologies to create national datasets. This North America dataset was produced by combining the national land cover datasets. The integration of the three national products merged four \nLand Cover map sections, Alaska, Canada, the conterminous United States and Mexico.\n\nPurpose:\nInformation on land cover across North America provided by this dataset is valuable for a range of audiences, including international organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, nongovernmental conservation organizations, land managers, and scientific researchers. The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North America’s changing environment.\n\nThe North American Environmental Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These 30-meter land cover data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:100,000-scale data.

    "abstract": "This data set shows Level I, II, and III ecological regions (ecoregions) of North America and is an update and revision of terrestrial ecoregions released by CEC in 2009. This current cartographic layer consists of an integration of updated ecoregions in Mexico, United States and Canada by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Government of Canada; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, respectively.",
    "detailed_description": "Ecoregions are areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. The ecoregions in this data set are based on the premise that a hierarchy of ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of both living and nonliving phenomena, such as geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology, that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity. All the characteristics are considered when determining ecoregions, but the relative importance of each characteristic may vary from one ecoregion to another. \n\nDifferent levels of ecological regions are identified with a Roman numeral hierarchical scheme. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 broad ecological regions. The 50 level II North American ecological regions provide a more detailed description of the large ecological areas nested within the level I regions and are useful for national and sub-continental overviews of ecological patterns. The 182 level III ecological regions, smaller ecological areas nested within level II regions, enhance regional environmental monitoring, assessment, and reporting, as well as decision-making.   \n\nThe challenging task of determining North American ecoregions has been the result of research and consultation between federal, state, provincial, and territorial agencies, as well as nongovernmental groups, universities, institutes, and the CEC. This data set represents an update of North American ecoregions derived from national agencies from Canada, the United States and Mexico, aligned with CEC terrestrial ecoregions classification scheme. CEC terrestrial ecoregions classifications represents the working group’s best consensus on the distribution and characteristics of major ecosystems at all three levels across North America.",

    "abstract": "Distribution maps summarize occurrence of habitat types in grid cells of 5 minutes of longitude × 3 minutes of latitude, i.e. approximately 6 × 5.5 km. However, the grid drawn on the maps has a cell size of 10 × 6 minutes and each of its cells includes four nested cells containing habitat occurrence data. The maps show the distribution of habitat types as recorded during fi eld mapping in 2001–2008, with some additions based on relevés from the Czech National Phytosociological Database recorded in the field in the period of 1991–2009.",
    "detailed_description": "This book acts as a manual that defines units used for habitat mapping in the Czech Republic. The system of Czech habitat types is compatible with those delimited in Annex I of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), a European Union legal instrument for the development of Natura 2000, a network of Special Areas of Conservation whose purpose is the protection of European natural habitats, wild fauna and flora. However, unlike the Annex I list, which includes only selected habitats of high conservation value, the Czech system of habitat classification is comprehensive: it contains all major habitat types occurring in the country and enables assignment of any site in the fi eld to a particular habitat type. In some cases, the delimitations of habitat types within Natura 2000 do not reflect actual patterns of variation observed in the Czech Republic and in fact contrast sharply with traditional systems of vegetation classification used in this country. Therefore, the habitat classification presented in this Catalogue has been developed as a compromise between the Natura 2000 system and adequate description of Czech habitat types. It is appropriate for description and management of Czech natural habitats, while remaining unequivocally transferable into the classification used in Natura 2000. \n\nThe first edition of the Habitat Catalogue was published in 2001. After its publication, an extensive habitat mapping programme was carried out in the Czech Republic, organised by the Agency of Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection of the Czech Republic and involving a few hundred fi eld workers. Baseline mapping took place in 2001–2004 and since 2006 data have been regularly updated, with effectively one twelfth of the Czech territory re-mapped every year. A parallel project of habitat monitoring based on permanent plots began in 2008. Field mapping has significantly improved our knowledge of the distribution and conservation status of particular habitats in the country. In addition, the system of phytosociological classification of Czech vegetation has been extensively revised since the publication of the first edition of the Habitat Catalogue, based on the analysis of the Czech National Phytosociological Database. The second edition of the Habitat Catalogue reflects this progress, as well as changes in the delimitation of habitat types at the European level. It contains entirely new distribution maps of habitat types based on the results of field mapping, estimations of the total area of each habitat in the country, revised lists of typical species of each habitat, more detailed comments regarding threats and conservation management, updated correspondence between habitat types of the Czech Republic and those defined in Annex I of the Habitats Directive and in the EUNIS system, and updated lists of references. \n\nThe basic division of the Habitat Catalogue is into nine groups of habitats, including: \nV Streams and water bodies \nM Wetlands and riverine vegetation \nR Springs and mires \nS Cliffs and boulder screes\n A Alpine treeless habitats \nT Secondary grasslands and heathlands \nK Scrub \nL Forests \nX Habitats strongly influenced or created by man \n\nWithin each group, habitats are subdivided into units (codes such as T8) and subunits (codes such as T8.2). There are a total of 140 subunits and undivided units. For the sake of compatibility with Natura 2000 and some other systems of habitat classification (e.g. the Emerald system), additional subunits at the lowest hierarchical level are used in some cases, with codes such as T8.2A. Habitats of group X are described only briefly, as they are not the focus of nature conservation. They are, however, necessary for comprehensive site description. For the sake of continuity, the delimitation of Czech habitat types and their codes remain the same as in the first edition of the Habitat Catalogue, except the merging of habitats X10 and X11, and changes in some subunits at the lowest hierarchical level.",

Amongst terrestrial and freshwater habitats the highest percentage of threatened types (categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable) was found amongst mires and bogs (85% in the EU28, 54% in the EU28+), followed by grasslands (53%, 49%), freshwater habitats (46%, 38%) and coastal habitats (45%, 43%). Relatively low percentages of heathland and scrub, forests, and sparsely vegetated habitats were assessed to be threatened. Overall the amount of threatened habitats was higher in the EU28 (36%) than in the wider range of the EU28+ (31%). The European Red List of Habitats provides extensive additional information on habitat classification and definition, pressures and threats, conservation and restorability of habitats, distribution, status and trends in individual countries, and sub-habitats that may possibly be threatened. The information provided can inform and support European nature and biodiversity policy in a variety of ways, particularly in relation to the EU2020 Biodiversity Strategy targets. Further applications include the revitalisation of the EUNIS habitat classification, synergies with the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services initiative, and the improvement of Red List methodologies.",

Lastly, spatial land cover datasets for St. Kitts, Nevis, and St. Eustatius were created using Landsat ETM+ imagery dated between 1999 and 2003.",
    "detailed_description": "For the map of St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Eustatius and the map of Grenada, we used decision tree software to classify Landsat image mosaics over the two study areas. In the classifications, we combined ancillary raster data, like topographic variables, with the Landsat image bands. The Landsat imagery included one image mosaic and one image for Grenada, and two image mosaics for the St. Kitts study area. The image mosaics were developed by applying regression trees to normalize images from other dates to fill the cloudy areas present in the base scene for each mosaic. We then assessed accuracy of the Landsat image classifications with 1-meter (m) pan-sharpened, false color IKONOS imagery dated from 2000-2003. For a few remaining cloudy areas, we manually interpreted forest formations and land cover from the IKONOS imagery.\n\nFor the map of Barbados, we first mapped forest formations and land cover by manually interpreting 1-m pan-sharpened, true color IKONOS imagery, circa 2000. Much of Barbados was cloud-obscured in all available Landsat imagery. Also, because we did not have multiseason imagery for Barbados, some forest formations were generalized. Secondly, we quantified the extents of protected forest by formation for all five of the islands. For Grenada, Barbados and St. Eustatius, we used a protected area database for the insular Caribbean produced by The Nature Conservancy. The primary source for protected areas was the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA-Consortium 2003), which was enhanced using country-scale protected area information (TNC 2007). All the Barbados protected areas in the database are only informally protected. A 1000-ft contour provided boundaries for protected lands on Nevis, because development is prohibited above that elevation. Boundaries for the new central forest reserve on St. Kitts, which include most lands above 1000 ft elevation, came from the St. Kitts Physical Planning Division. We manually digitized boundaries for Brimstone Hill National Park, in St. Kitts.\n\nAs in Helmer et al. (2002), the forest and shrubland classes are designated to the formation level. Formations are adapted from Areces-Malea et al. (1999), who classify Caribbean vegetation according to standards of the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC 1997). To avoid confusion with some FGDC standards, we use only the term semi-deciduous (after Areces-Mallea et al. 1999), and we use it for stands with 25 to 75% of deciduous woody canopy species. Mixed refers to mixed ever-green and deciduous cover that includes trees or shrubs at maturity, as in Areces-Malea et al. (1999). At least 75% of seasonal evergreen and evergreen canopy species are evergreen.\n\nForest includes lands with at least 25% tree or tree plus shrub cover, combining the two forest successional stages of Helmer et al. (2002). The one case in which we distinguish the younger forest/shrub class is where young stands are drought deciduous but adjacent older forest is semi-deciduous (forest/shrub includes lands with 25-60% tree plus shrub cover, or ≥60% cover of uniformly young seedlings or saplings that may include shrubs). As in Helmer et al. (2002), we reserve the term woodland for lands with >25% canopy cover of drought deciduous shrubs or trees. In the map legends we generalized the driest coastal forest and shrubland formations into one class. With the exception of large patches of Coccoloba uvifera on St. Kitts, most patches of coastal evergreen forest were too small to be distinct from the matrix of drought deciduous and mixed formations. In addition, in Barbados, the class deciduous, evergreen coastal and mixed forest or shrubland (with or without succulents), also includes a mosaic of drought deciduous, semi-deciduous and seasonal evergreen forest/shrub below and to the northeast of Mt. Hillaby.\n\nWe used a regression tree method (Helmer and Ruefenacht 2005) to make nearly cloud-free image mosaics. Details on the method are available in Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005). Most of the Landsat scenes were terrain-corrected, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images. We also used two ETM+ images over the St. Kitts area and one Landsat 5 image over Grenada that were not terrain-corrected. All images were co-registered, to within <1 pixel root mean square error, to the clearest terrain-corrected image for each study area.\n\nWe made two image mosaics for the St. Kitts study area (Helmer and Ruefenacht 2007), including one mosaic for each of two stages of phenology for drought deciduous woody vegetation. Drought deciduous woody vegetation was “leaf-on” in the base scene for the mosaic from the be-ginning of the dry season. Drought deciduous woody vegetation was in a “leaf-off” state in the base image for the other. For Grenada, we made one image mosaic and used a Landsat 5 scene as a leaf-off image in the classification.\n\nWe evaluated whether the decision tree software See5 (http://www.rulequest .com) could effectively classify cloud-cleared Landsat imagery 1) in Grenada, and 2) for a more detailed set of classes than previous work in the St. Kitts study area. Reference, or training data for each classification consisted of 25 to >100 multipixel patches distributed throughout the extent of each class, resulting in a dense training dataset of thousands of pixels per class. The data included field-based data for St. Kitts, Nevis, and Grenada that was collected between January and June 2003. Field data collection relied on simultaneously observing land cover and forest formation both in satellite imagery and in the field. In the field we integrated a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver with a laptop computer (with a daylight-viewable image display) running the ERDAS Imagine GPS tool (Leica-Geosystems 2003).\n\nTo distribute training data throughout the extent of each class, we then supplemented these field data by visually interpreting pan-sharpened, 1-m false color or true color IKONOS images. The IKONOS imagery was from the years 2000-2001 for St. Kitts and Nevis, and from 2003 for Grenada. The images were dated between October and February, when drought deciduous woody vegetation was in a leaf-on stage. Field work in St. Kitts and Nevis included traversing eight elevation gradients on windward and leeward sides of these islands. This extensive training data allowed us to estimate the elevations where seasonal evergreen forest changed to ever-green forest for different windward and leeward slopes, even though these two forest types were not visually distinct in the IKONOS imagery. The training data for sugar cane included subclasses that differed by field maturity. Most drought deciduous vegetation was in a leaf-off stage in the leaf-off image mosaic; however, we also included a separate training class for some patches of drought deciduous woodlands that were greened up in the leaf-off imagery. The training data also initially combined the signatures for large patches of coastal evergreen forest or shrubland in St. Kitts with seasonal evergreen forest for later editing. Spectral signatures for all barren lands were also combined, and barren lands were later manually separated into different classes (e.g. quarry, sand, bare ground) after decision tree classification. In mountainous areas, we collected a shadowed and sunlit version of each class (Helmer et al. 2000). In Grenada, training data for herbaceous agriculture were joined with training data for pasture, and herbaceous agriculture was manually recoded from pasture.\n\nAncillary data were combined with satellite imagery to create an island-wide predictor variable datasets for image classification. Topographic variables, derived from Shuttle Radar Topography mission digital elevation data (Farr and Kobrick 2000) included elevation, slope, slope position, aspect, and topographic shading based on the sun elevation and azimuth of each image date (or reference image date in the case of image mosaics). Vector derived variables included distance to roads, distance to coast, and distance to ravine. Finally, band indices and ratios were created from the Landsat image bands to produce the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 4/5 band ratio. The ancillary predictor data were spatially co-registered to and stacked with Landsat image bands 1–5, 7, and two-band indices to create a multi-band image for each image mosaic. For the St. Kitts study area, we also included variance over 3x3 windows of the 15-m pan band from the leaf-on image mosaic that we then resampled to a 30-m cell size.\n\nThe locations of each pixel in the training data were used to extract corresponding values of the image bands and ancillary data from the stack of raster data for each classification. These data were then input into the See5 software to create a classification model which we then applied to classify the raster data stack. We used the default values in See5 for classification with pruning. We also included the boosting option with 10 trials; each trial results in a new tree. Finally, we applied larger misclassification costs for the most common misclassifications from initial runs of the program. The classification model was then applied to the stack of raster data with the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) tool for ERDAS Imagine (Leica-Geosystems 2003) from the U.S. Geological Survey (ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/edcuser/dewitz/NLCD_mapping_tool).\n\nFor the study areas that underwent decision tree classification, stratified random samples, of about 50 pixels per class, provided data for estimating classification accuracies. The accuracy assessments excluded classes or areas that were entirely visually-interpreted: forested and non-forested wetlands in the St. Kitts study area, herbaceous agriculture in Grenada and the remaining cloudy areas. Barren classes were also combined for the assessment. We differentiated the barren pixels by visual “heads-up” digitization over the IKONOS imagery. With evergreen and seasonal evergreen forest formations not being distinct in the IKONOS imagery, we combined them in the accuracy assessment. An error matrix was produced for each mapped class that estimates the overall percentage of correctly classified pixels, producer and user's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient.\n\nBecause forest formations and land cover for Barbados were for the most part manually delineated, we did not perform an accuracy assessment for that map. Very fine resolution imagery was not available for St. Eustatius at the time of the accuracy assessment. However, we verified and manually edited the classification for St. Eustatius based on the high resolution imagery that is now viewable on Google Earth (http://earth.google.com/).\n\n\nFor additional details see Helmer et al.

    "detailed_description": "We assembled a time series of maps for Puerto Rico for the years 1951, 1977, 1991, and 2000, which included land cover maps based on aerial photo interpretation for 1951 and 1977, maps of forest type and land cover in 1991 and 2000 based on Landsat satellite imagery, and a map of land development from 1991 to 2000 (Helmer and Ruefenacht, 2005). The satellite image–based maps for 1991–1992 and 2000 came from separately classifying two Landsat image mosaics; one mosaic was from imagery dated around the years 1991–1992, and one was from imagery dated around the year 2000. The image mosaics used the regression tree method of Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005) to fill cloudy areas in Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from other image dates, and they were the same two mosaics developed in that study.\n\nAncillary data were combined with satellite imagery to create an island-wide predictor variable dataset for image classification. Topographic variables, derived from USGS 30 meter (m) digital elevation models (DEM) included elevation, slope, aspect, and topographic shadow. Climatic variables included annual precipitation, mean temperature, and potential evapotranspiration-to-precipitation ratio. Vector derived variables included distance to roads, road density, and geology. Finally, band indices and ratios were created from the Landsat image bands to produce the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 4/5 band ratio. The ancillary predictor data were spatially co-registered to and stacked with Landsat image bands 1–5, 7, and two-band indices to create a multi-band image for each image mosaic.\n\nIsland-wide reconnaissance surveys in 1999–2000 and 2003, including airborne reconnaissance in 2003, were performed to collect training and reference data. The island wide field surveys and expert consultation with regional vegetation experts enabled us discern land cover and forest type on 1:33,000-scale color infrared aerial photos dated 1991 and 1:38,000-scale color photos dated 1999. Land cover and forest type interpreted in aerial photos and field surveys were then identified in the satellite imagery and used to create classification training data.\n\nTo classify the Landsat image mosaics for 1991–1992 and 2000 into forest types and land cover, we completed a supervised classification based on classification models developed with the decision tree software See5 (www.rulequest.com). Training data for the image classifications consisted of 50–150 multi-pixel patches distributed throughout the extent of each class. As a result, the number of training pixels for each class was in the thousands. In mountainous areas, sunlit and shadowed versions of major land-cover types were treated as separate classes and then later combined (Helmer et al. 2000).\n\nThe maps for 1991 and 2000 identify forest types down to the formation level. Forest includes lands with >25% cover of trees or trees that co-dominate with shrubs. Drought deciduous woodland includes lands with 25–60% (open) or >60% (dense) canopy cover dominated by drought deciduous leguminous shrubs and a relatively clear understory that indicates grazing and that may include herbaceous vegetation. Pasture and grass may have up to 25% woody vegetation cover. Cloud forest includes elfin, palm, and tall cloud forests, as well as forests that are transitional to cloud forests. Low to medium density urban and developed areas included lands with as little as 10–15% manmade covers. Consequently, they include some forest or grassland. High density urban lands had >80% cover of man-made structures.\n\nManual editing of the image-based maps was required to correct for confusion between urban, bare, and senescent pasture lands. We also manually delineated agriculture, inactive agricultural land, and hay/improved pasture in alluvial lowlands for the 2000 classification date. Some confusion between sun coffee and pasture was also manually edited in both dates. We applied the 1991 agricultural delineations from Helmer et al. (2002) for the 1991 time step. We also manually edited the boundary between semi-deciduous and evergreen forest in one part of the island. Finally, seasonally flooded savannas and woodlands were manually delineated in seasonally inundated areas, mainly along the southern coast. The manually interpreted area was 3.2% in 2000, and 5.8% in 1991, of the total area mapped.\n\nFor both classification dates, a stratified random sample generated about 50 validation points for each land cover class. The validation points for the 1991 classification came from Helmer et al. (2002). The aerial photographs for 1991 and 1999 served as reference data for identifying the class of each validation point in 1991 and 2000, respectively. The aerial photography eliminated restrictions on point locations, permitting us to include points that would otherwise not be accessible because of topography, remoteness, or property ownership. An error matrix was produced for each mapped class that estimates the overall percentage of correctly classified pixels, producer and user's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient.",

    "abstract": "Tropical forest managers need detailed maps of forest types for REDD+, but spectral similarity among forest types; cloud and scan-line gaps; and scarce vegetation ground plots make producing such maps with satellite imagery difficult. How can managers map tropical forest tree communities with satellite imagery given these challenges? Here we describe a case study of mapping tropical forests to floristic classes with gap-filled Landsat imagery by judicious combination of field and remote sensing work. For managers, we include background on current and forthcoming solutions to the problems of mapping detailed tropical forest types with Landsat imagery. In the study area, Trinidad and Tobago, class characteristics like deciduousness allowed discrimination of floristic classes. We also discovered that we could identify most of the tree communities in (1) imagery with fine spatial resolution of 61 m; (2) multiseason fine resolution imagery (viewable with Google Earth); or (3) Landsat imagery from different dates, particularly imagery from drought years, even if decades old, allowing us to collect the extensive training data needed for mapping tropical forest types with ‘‘noisy’’ gap-filled imagery. Further, we show that gap-filled, synthetic multiseason Landsat imagery significantly improves class-specific accuracy for several seasonal forest associations. The class-specific improvements were better for comparing classification results; for in some cases increases in overall accuracy were small. These detailed mapping efforts can lead to new views of tropical forest landscapes. Here we learned that the xerophytic rain forest of Tobago is closely associated with ultramafic geology, helping to explain its unique physiognomy.",

    "abstract": "Estimating forest area at a national scale within the United Nations program of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) is primarily based on land cover information using remote sensing technologies. Timely delivery for a country of a size like Mexico can only be achieved in a standardized and cost-effective manner by automatic image classification. This paper describes the operational land cover monitoring system for Mexico. It utilizes national-scale cartographic reference data, all available Landsat satellite imagery, and field inventory data for validation. Seven annual national land cover maps between 1993 and 2008 were produced. The classification scheme defined 9 and 12 classes at two hierarchical levels. Overall accuracies achieved were up to 76%. Tropical and temperate forest was classified with accuracy up to 78% and 82%, respectively. Although specifically designed for the needs of Mexico, the general process is suitable for other participating countries in the REDD+ program to comply with guidelines on standardization and transparency of methods and to assure comparability. However, reporting of change is ill-advised based on the annual land cover products and a combination of annual land cover and change detection algorithms is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Forest formation and land cover maps for several Caribbean islands were developed from satellite imagery as part of a multi-organizational project. For the map of Barbados (Helmer et al., 2008), we used decision tree software as the original approach to classify Landsat ETM+ images. Unfortunately the high cloud cover in the available Landsat images led to a low-quality classified map in many areas. Ikonos images for the years 2001 and 2002 where obtained and used as the basis to classify most of the island by \"heads-up\" digitizing.

    "detailed_description": "Satellite image-based mapping of tropical forests is vital to conservation planning. Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we first test an approach to image interpretation for mapping forest formations and land-cover on four islands of the Lesser Antilles. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and examine whether cultivated areas or forest cover changed over the second half of the 20th century. The image interpretation approach stacks image mosaics with ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting stack of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to alternate scene dates to fill cloudy areas in a base scene. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that would be confused with more standard methods; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones.\n\nCultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. Unless sugar cane cultivation becomes more profitable and competitive on the islands where it previously dominated agriculture, this trend will likely continue. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Lowland forests, however, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new forest conservation reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering lowland forest clearing for agriculture.",

The figure below shows that a large number of topics are addressed that are logically related to each other. The size of an ecosystem together with the quality of that ecosystem determines the quantity and nature of the ecosystem services provided: the physical supply and use tables. This physical supply of services is also valued monetarily and can ultimately be related to the national accounts . In addition, thematic datasets and maps have been developed that show the carbon balance and biodiversity. These are further explained under the various themes.",

    "abstract": "Estuaries have great ecological and economic value and sustain both population and economic growth. Global-scale analyses suggest that human activities drive estuarine area change but these projections neglect direct human-estuary interactions and socio-economic feedbacks. Here, we quantified area changes of 2,396 estuaries in response to recent human impacts (e.g., land reclamation, estuarine dam construction) and economic development between 1984 and 2019, and find that estuarine area shrank by 5,372 km2 whereas upland submergence created 5,015 km2 of estuarine area elsewhere. Approximately 44% (n = 1,046) of today's estuaries have been directly altered through land reclamation, estuarine dam construction, or a combination of both, and ∼250,000 acres (1,027 km2) of estuarine area have been directly converted to urban or agricultural fields. Nearly 90% (923 km2) of land reclamation occurred in Asia linked to recent advances in economic development during the middle-income stage. Additional historical mapping and 5-year interval analyses revealed that while human alterations were insignificant during the low-income stages, estuaries were predominantly altered during their middle-income stages, where estuarine degradation is a common consequence of economic growth. However, this trend stabilizes in high-income countries with the adaption of conservation laws and policies. Together, our results indicate that large-scale estuarine loss can be avoided by preserving estuaries in low- and mid-income countries in the early stages of economic development.",

    "detailed_description": "Until global wall-to-wall remote sensing data from more specialized sensors are available, maps from multispectral image time series and predictor data should help with running ecosystem models and as sustainable development indicators. Our purpose here is to paint a picture for the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (PRVI), of the outcome for tropical forests of large-scale clearing and regrowth given variable climate, topography, soil substrates and disturbance history; of colonization by several exotic species; and of protected areas established at different times.\n\nTowards that goal, we first assemble a database of tree species functional traits and other characteristics. Secondly, we apply two approaches to modeling and mapping several attributes of forests including: a) counts and relative basal areas of introduced, native and endemic tree species; b) relative basal areas of selected functional groups; c) forest structure and biomass; and d) individual tree species distributions. Helmer et al. (2018) briefly discusses the relative advantages of the two modeling methods. Our purpose was also to evaluate spatial patterns of disturbance history, protection, climate, geology and topography and address the implications of these and related results for Earth System Models (ESMs) and forest sustainability, specifically, forest-related aspects of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) 15, particularly Target 15.2, Indicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management.\n\nThe study area is a collection of Caribbean islands encompassing Puerto Rico, including Vieques, Culebra and Mona and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. The climate is tropical, under the definition of tropical as having no frost at sea level. The tropical forest types range from young and old secondary forest to old forest, and from dry forests to humid forests including deciduous, semi-deciduous and evergreen forests including cloud forests. Soils include alluvial soils that are mostly in lowland areas, and soils formed over limestone, volcanic, and serpentine substrates. Most limestone areas have complex karst topography. For a given climate, forests formed on limestone and serpentine substrates have leaf types or growth forms leaning toward those of drier forests, given fast-draining soils. Serpentine (ultramafic) substrates not only have fast-draining soils, but they are also nutrient poor and have toxic levels of some metals.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "Remote sensing of forest vertical structure is possible with lidar data, but lidar is not widely available. Here we map tropical dry forest height (RMSE=0.9 m, R2=0.84, range 0.6–7 m), and we map foliage height profiles, with a time series of Landsat and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) imagery on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, substituting time for vertical canopy space. We also simultaneously map forest disturbance type and age. We map these variables in the context of avian habitat studies, particularly for wintering habitat of an endangered Nearctic-Neotropical migrant bird, the Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii). We also illustrate relationships between forest vertical structure, disturbance type and counts of forage species important to the Kirtland's Warbler. The ALI imagery and the Landsat time series are both critical to the result for forest height, which the strong relationship of forest height with disturbance type and age facilitates. Also unique to this study is that seven of the eight image time steps are cloud-cleared images: mosaics of the clear parts of several cloudy scenes. We created each cloud-cleared image, including a virtually seamless ALI image mosaic, with regression tree normalization. We also illustrate how viewing time series imagery as red–green–blue composites of tasseled cap wetness (RGB wetness composites) aids reference data collection for classifying tropical forest disturbance type and age. Our results strongly support current Landsat Program production of co-registered imagery, and they emphasize the value of seamless time series of cloud-cleared imagery.",

    "abstract": "Improved conservation of the distinct natural vegetation types that occur on Caribbean islands is greatly facilitated if these vegetation types are accurately understood, described, and mapped in a manner that is accepted and respected by the diversity of countries, cultures, and peoples that make up the Caribbean today. The Caribbean Vegetation Classification and Atlas Project has been a key step towards characterizing the natural vegetation and landcover of the region, island-by-island, based on a newly derived standardized vegetation and classification system. This Project has involved the following key steps: - review of existing vegetation classification efforts - convening of a Caribbean Vegetation Ecology Working Group - development of a Standard Classification System for the Caribbean - production of a Vegetation and Landcover Atlas following the newly derived standard classification system\n\nAfter an exhaustive review of existing vegetation classification systems, a standardized vegetation classification system was developed and set of maps which characterize the vegetation types of the Caribbean in a scientifically consistent manner.",
    "detailed_description": "A total of 104 vegetation formations were recognized for the Caribbean region—24 of which are new to the ICEC system. These 104 units are estimated to cover about 95% of the theoretical total number of vegetation formations potentially existing in the Caribbean islands. Descriptions of the Caribbean vegetation formations were developed, arranged with respect to their subordinate position within each major category of the ICEC system. Each standard term corresponding to a formation was accompanied by a short, abbreviated name both in English and Spanish, to be used as a mapping label. The most important formations—according to this new Caribbean system—were crosslisted with their equivalent vegetation units used in previous local or regional classification systems in the Caribbean, and a table with 438 components was developed. This effort, presented in Chapter Four, reconciled 21 of the most important vegetation systems used throughout the Caribbean islands.\n\nA detailed, preliminary system of classification of the vegetation communities of the Caribbean Islands at the more precise alliances and associations level was also developed. Given the complexity of an archipelago that is considered one of the richest in the world in terms of plants species and communities, this was an extraordinary task. The new Caribbean vegetation system, based upon FGDC's classification standards recognized, named, and described 187 alliances. In addition, 199 associations were recognized and named. More than 90% of the associations were also briefly described, based onthe knowledge of the Vegetation Ecology Experts Working Group (See Appendix Three). This classification effort is estimated to have included about 50% of the theoretical total number of vegetation alliances and about 30% of all associations present in the Caribbean islands, many of which are still to be defined, named, and described. We estimate that there are about 350 vegetation alliances and 750 to 800 vegetation associations for the West Indian Islands",

There are two spatial land cover datasets, provided in multiple formats, that represent land-cover and woody vegetation formations using multi-part Landsat ETM+ scenes centered around the year 2000. Also included is a digital elevation model (DEM) that was created using discrete lidar data collected in 2004. The DEM was created by filtering ground (minimum elevation) and non-ground (mean and maximum elevation) returns to create a bare earth DEM and forest height estimates for the islands of St. John and St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. Two additional raster datasets include models that displays the spatial representation of lidar derived (1) dominant co-dominant tree height estimates and (2) above ground biomass estimates for the islands of St. John and St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands.",
    "detailed_description": "Process Steps for Virgin_Islands_Land_Cover files: IITF_JRS02_usbvi_landcov1*.* and IITF_JRS02_usbvi_landcov2*.*\n\nWe classified multi-part Landsat ETM+ imagery scenes that were pan-sharpened for the year 2000. Cloudy parts of the reference dates for each scene were replaced by image data from cloud-free parts of other image dates. Scene parts for non-reference dates had been radiometrically matched to reference dates for each scene with regression tree models, and cloud-filled scenes were radiometrically matched to each other with histogram matching. The imagery scenes and extents included the following:\n\nPath / Row / Scene / Mosaic\n4 / 47 / p004r047_20000327 / Base\n3 / 47 / p003r047_20011102 / Match\n4 / 47 / p004r47_19990917 / Match\n4 / 47 / p004r47_20000802 / Match\n4 / 47 / p004r47_20010125 / Match\n4 / 48 / p004r48_20000327 / Base\n4 / 48 / p004r48_20010125 / Match\n\nAncillary data were combined with satellite imagery to create an island-wide predictor variable dataset for image classification. Topographic variables, derived from USGS 30 m digital elevation models (DEM) included elevation, slope, aspect, curvature and facet. Climatic variables included mean annual precipitation and temperature. Vector derived variables included distance to roads, distance to streams (ghuts) and distance to coastlines. Finally, band indices and ratios were created from the Landsat image bands to produce the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 4/5 band ratio. The ancillary predictor data were spatially co-registered with the cloud free image mosaics for the two time periods and stacked with the native Landsat reflectance bands 1-5 and 7 at a spectral resolution of 15 m, resulting in a 18 band image for each classification time period.\n\nField reference surveys were performed during a reconnaissance visit in 2004 to collect training and reference data. The island wide field surveys and expert consultation with regional vegetation experts enabled us to discern land cover attributes and forest formation from 1 m IKONOS panchromatic sharpened imagery and 1 m color DOQQs. Land-cover and forest formation were then identified in the satellite imagery based on a comparison to areas interpreted in reference imagery and the spatial location of field reference survey data. Forest formation was identifiable in both the reference imagery and the Landsat imagery by a number of factors including spectral components such as color, contrast, tone and texture as well as spatial indicators including geology and elevation. Difficulties distinguishing forest formation were encountered in transitional areas including semi-deciduous and seasonal evergreen forest. Field survey data collected meeting this criteria proved useful in the identification of uncertain forest transitions.\n\nThe decision tree classifier See5 (www.rulequest.com) was used for landcover and forest formation classification of Landsat ETM+ imagery for the year 2000. Training data polygons for each land-cover and land-use class were converted to an ASCII point file providing spatial coordinates, class name and assigned class number. The classification was performed with a 10 trial adaptive boosting option to improve the overall accuracy by combining many decision trees into a single combined classifier. This process provides more predicted data to analyze before determining each final class (www.rulequest.com). The default global pruning option was also used to reduce the likelihood of over fitting the tree to the training data. The pruning process removes predicted parts of the decision tree with relatively high error rates and makes decisions as to the final class assignment.\n\nManual edit confused classes using 1 m IKONOS multispectral imagery and 1 m DOQQ reference data.\n\nManually digitize areas where remaining cloud and cloud shadow artifacts exist in image mosaics.\n\nA stratified random sample generated approximately 50 validation points for each landcover class. The 1 m IKONOS imagery (dates ranging from 2000 to 2003) and DOQQ (2004) data were used to verify the accuracy assessment points for each class in the classified images. Using high resolution imagery to validate the classification eliminated restrictions on point locations, permitting us to include points that would otherwise not be accessible because of topography, remoteness, or property ownership. An error matrix was produced for each mapped class that estimates the overall percentage of correctly classified pixels, producer and user's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the state and trends in agriculture production is essential to combat both short-term and long-term threats to stable and reliable access to food for all, and to ensure a profitable agricultural sector. Starting in 2009, the Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology Branch (STB) at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) began the process of generating annual crop type digital maps. Focusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (Radarsat-2) based satellite images. Beginning with the 2011 growing season, this activity has been extended to other provinces in support of a national crop inventory. To date this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m (56m in 2009 and 2010).",
    "detailed_description": "For 15 years the Earth Observation Team of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has been mapping crop types of individual fields in Canada. They developed an operational software system to decipher crop types using satellite observations and trustworthy ground information. Successful crop identification relies on image acquisitions from multiple sensors during key crop phenological stages (reproduction, seed development and senescence). \n\nMulti-temporal optical data are the primary data source for crop classification because the NIR/SWIR channels are vital to crop classifications. Over a growing season, a minimum of three optical images are required to successfully identify crops. To the optical data, c-band radar data is added to help with physical plant structures and moisture measurements. In 2009 and 2010 the ScanSAR mode of RADARSAT-2, with its large swath (300 km) and moderate resolution (50 m), was used as it fits the agricultural landscape of the Prairie Provinces. From 2011-2019, the finer resolution of RADARSAT2’s Wide mode (30 m) was used, as it is better suited to the smaller fields in the rest of Canada. This finer resolution SAR data continues today with 30m Compact-Pol data from RCM. \n\nAnnual crop insurance data are the most accurate, detailed and complete sources of information for crop types in Canada. As such, AAFC has agreements with some provincial crop insurance agencies to use their data for the training and validation of the classification process. For provinces where insurance data cannot be accessed, ground-truth information is provided by point observations from AAFC staff or other provincial sources. Each year, AAFC staff collects tens of thousands of points identifying crops across the country. These point sources are combined and used as training or reference sites as well. \n\nThe training and validation data used to classify non-agricultural land cover types comes from numerous Land Cover / Land Use products, including the AAFC semi-decadal land use time series. Point data are taken from these products and adjusted (eliminating any that were in transitions areas between classes or in areas of high potential change (i.e. near urban expansion)). What remains is a stable series of known land cover points for the following classes: water, barren, urban, shrubland, wetland, grassland, agriculture (generalized), and forest. \n\nFocusing on the Prairie Provinces in 2009 and 2010, a Decision Tree (DT) based methodology was applied using optical (Landsat-5, AWiFS, DMC) and radar (RADARSAT-2) imagery. The final map had a spatial resolution of 56m. \n\nFor the 2011 and 2012 growing season, this activity was extended to all the other provinces (except Newfoundland) in support of a national crop inventory. The final spatial resolution was increased to 30m, to aid in differentiating the smaller fields in the rest of Canada.  For 2012, the lack of affordable optical data forced AAFC to rely mostly on RADARSAT-2 data. \n\nIn 2013, this activity expanded to include Newfoundland for the first time, and move to Landsat-8 as its sole-source of optical imagery. RADARSAT-2 continued to be the source of radar imagery. This combination of optical and radar imagery had been repeated over the agricultural extent of Canada in the subsequent years, until 2016 when Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-1 optical imagery were added. The Gaofen imagery was dropped after the 2017 season. For the 2021 map, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) satellites became the source of radar imagery. In 2022, Landsat-9 imagery was added to the optical collection. \n\nAt present, this approach can consistently deliver a crop inventory that meets the overall target accuracy of at least 85% at a final spatial resolution of 30m. \n\nNote: At the national scale, the crop type legend is not homogeneous. In some provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Quebec, we have been able to divide the crop types in to sub-categories (i.e. winter versus spring wheat). For other provinces, those classes may not have been subdivided. A lack of training sites and, in some cases, a limited availability of spectral data does not allow for the differentiation of crops into sub-categories with sufficient precision. This can result in class discontinuities between provinces.",

    "abstract": "Satellite-Based Forest Inventory (SBFI) informing on Canada’s forested land cover, disturbance recovery, structure, species, stand age from 2020, and stand-replacing disturbances from 1985-2020. The SBFI polygons represent homogeneous forest conditions akin to those of stands delineated in a strategic forest inventory. Over 25 million SBFI polygons were delineated using a multiresolution segmentation algorithm applied to the 2020 Landsat surface-reflectance BAP image composite (30-m spatial resolution), fire year, and harvest year layers derived from Landsat with the C2C approach. A minimum map unit of 0.45 ha (5 pixels) was used to define polygons. The entirety of Canada’s forest ecosystems were mapped using the same data, attributes, and temporal representation, resulting in a common vegetation inventory system of Canada’s ~650 Mha forested ecosystems. Given the large and diverse forest area of Canada, the strength of an SBFI lies in its use of a consistent data source and methodology across jurisdictional boundaries, and across managed and unmanaged forest areas, enabling consistently generated synoptic, spatially explicit information outputs. The data included herein are based upon free and open satellite data and information products following established and communicated approaches.",
    "detailed_description": "Satellite data are increasingly used to provide information to support forest monitoring and reporting at varying levels of detail and for a range of attributes and spatial extents. Forests are dynamic environments and benefit from regular assessments to capture status and changes both locally and over large areas. Satellite data can provide products relevant to forest science and management on a regular basis (e.g. annually) for land cover, disturbance (i.e. date, extent, severity, and type), forest recovery (e.g. quantification of return of trees following disturbance), and forest structure (e.g. volume, biomass, canopy cover, stand height), with products generated over large areas in a systematic, transparent, and repeatable fashion. While pixel-based outcomes are typical based upon satellite data inputs, many end users continue to require polygon-based forest inventory information. To meet this information need and have a spatial context for forest inventory attributes such as tree species assemblages, we present a new work-flow to produce a novel spatially explicit, stand-level satellite-based forest inventory (SBFI) in Canada applying image segmentation approaches to generate spatially unique forest stands (polygons), which are the fundamental spatial unit of management-level inventories. Thus, SBFI offers spatial context to aggregate and generalize other pixel-based forest data sets. Canada has developed a National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System (NTEMS) that utilizes medium spatial resolution imagery, chiefly from Landsat, to annually characterize Canada’s forests at a pixel level from 1984 until present. These NTEMS datasets are used to populate SBFI polygons with information regarding status (e.g. current land cover type, dominant tree species, or total biomass) as well as information on dynamics (e.g. has this polygon been subject to change, when, by what, and if so, how is the forest recovering). Here, we outline the information drivers for forest monitoring, present a set of products aimed at meeting these information needs, and follow to demonstrate the SBFI concept over the 650-Mha extent of Canada’s forest-dominated ecosystems. In so doing, the entirety of Canada’s forest ecosystems (managed and unmanaged) were mapped using the same data, attributes, and temporal representation. Moreover, the use of polygons allows for the generation of attributes such as tree species composition, and total biomass and wood volume in a stand-scale format familiar to landscape managers and suitable for strategic planning. The data, methods, and outcomes presented here are portable to other regions and input data sources, and the national SBFI outcomes for Canada are available via open access.",

    "abstract": "Tropical forest managers need detailed maps of forest types for REDD+, but spectral similarity among forest types; cloud and scan-line gaps; and scarce vegetation ground plots make producing such maps with satellite imagery difficult. How can managers map tropical forest tree communities with satellite imagery given these challenges? Here we describe a case study of mapping tropical forests to floristic classes with gap-filled Landsat imagery by judicious combination of field and remote sensing work. For managers, we include background on current and forthcoming solutions to the problems of mapping detailed tropical forest types with Landsat imagery. In the study area, Trinidad and Tobago, class characteristics like deciduousness allowed discrimination of floristic classes. We also discovered that we could identify most of the tree communities in (1) imagery with fine spatial resolution of 61 m; (2) multiseason fine resolution imagery (viewable with Google Earth); or (3) Landsat imagery from different dates, particularly imagery from drought years, even if decades old, allowing us to collect the extensive training data needed for mapping tropical forest types with ‘‘noisy’’ gap-filled imagery. Further, we show that gap-filled, synthetic multiseason Landsat imagery significantly improves class-specific accuracy for several seasonal forest associations. The class-specific improvements were better for comparing classification results; for in some cases increases in overall accuracy were small. These detailed mapping efforts can lead to new views of tropical forest landscapes. Here we learned that the xerophytic rain forest of Tobago is closely associated with ultramafic geology, helping to explain its unique physiognomy.",

The outcomes showed the current spatial distribution of P. oceanica, covering a known area of 1,224,707 ha and highlighted the lack of relevant data in part of the basin (21,471 linear km of coastline). The estimated regression of meadows amounted to 34% in the last 50 years, showing that this generalised phenomenon had to be mainly ascribed to cumulative effects of multiple local stressors. Our results highlighted the importance of enforcing surveys to assess the status and prioritize areas where cost-effective schemes for threats reduction, capable of reversing present patterns of change and ensuring P. oceanica persistence at Mediterranean scale, could be implemented.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "The imminent implementation of a REDD+ MRV system in Mexico in 2015, demanding operational annual land cover change reporting, requires highly accurate, annual and high resolution forest type maps; not only for monitoring but also to establish the historical baseline from the 1990s onwards. The employment of any supervised classifier demands exhaustive definition of land cover classes and the representation of all classes in the training stage. This paper reports the process of a data driven class separability analysis and the definition and application of a national land cover classification scheme. All Landsat data recorded over Mexico in the year 2000 with cloud coverage below 10 percent and a national digital elevation model have been used. Automatic wall-2-wall image classification has been performed trained by national reference data on land use and vegetation types with 66 classes. Validation has been performed against field plots of the national forest inventory. Groups of non-separable classes have subsequently been discerned by automatic iterative class aggregation. Class aggregations have finally been manually revised and modified towards a proposed national land cover classification scheme at 4 levels with 35 classes at the highest level including 13 classes for primary temperate and tropical forests, 2 classes for secondary temperate and tropical forest, 1 for induced or cultivated forest, as also 8 different scrubland classes. The remaining 11 classes cover agriculture, grassland, wetland, water bodies, urban and other vegetation land cover classes. The remaining 3 levels provide further hierarchic aggregations with 14, 10, and 8 classes, respectively. Trained by the relabeled training dataset wall-2-wall classification towards the 35 classes has been performed. The final national land cover dataset has been validated against more than 200,000 polygons randomly distributed all over the country with class labels derived by manual interpretation. The agreement for all 35 classes at level 4 was 71%. Primary forest classes have been identified with accuracies between 60% and 83%. Secondary forest classes rated only 50% finding major confusion with the primary forest classes. Accuracies over the scrubland classes have been calculated between 60% and 90%. Agreements for aggregated temperate and tropical forest classes was 85% and 80%, respectively. Separation of forest and non-forest has been achieved with an agreement of 87%.",

    "abstract": "Distributions of land cover and forest formations for Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra were mapped from previously published Landsat satellite image mosaics dated 1991 and 2000. This file is the map of land cover and forest formations for about the year 2000 for Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra. These data are the original basis for the 2001 NLCD data from the USGS.\n\nImportant notes: \n1. Open drought deciduous woodlands, with 25 to 60% woody vegetation cover, are grouped with pasture in the version of this map that is generalized to land cover. \n2. Low density urban lands are included with the Urban class and may have as little as 10-15% urban/built-up lands. \n3. Errors from minor misregristration between the maps from 1991-2000 will cause some error in analyses of change. \n4. We recommend using urban change data from Helmer and Ruefenacht (2005) to estimate urban change from 1991-2000. \n\nOn the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, forest, urban/built-up and pasture lands have replaced most formerly cultivated lands. The extent and age distribution of each forest type that undergoes land development, however, is unknown. This study assembles a time series of four land-cover maps for Puerto Rico. The time series includes two digitized paper maps of land cover in 1951 and 1978 that are based on photo interpretation. The other two maps are of forest type and land cover and are based on decision tree classification of Landsat image mosaics dated 1991 and 2000. With the map time series we quantify land-cover changes from 1951 to 2000; map forest age classes in 1991 and 2000; and quantify the forest that undergoes land development (urban development or surface mining) from 1991 to 2000 by forest type and age. This step relies on intersecting a map of land development from 1991-2000 (from the same satellite imagery) with the forest age and type maps. Land-cover changes from 1991-2000 that continue prior trends include urban expansion and transition of sugar cane, pineapple and other lowland agriculture to pasture. Forest recovery continues, but it has slowed. Emergent and forested wetland area increased between 1977 and 2000. Sun coffee cultivation appears to have increased slightly. Most of the forests cleared for land development, 55 percent, were young (1-13 yr). Only 13 percent of the developed forest was older (41-55+ yr). However, older forest on rugged karst lands that long ago reforested is vulnerable to land development if it is close to an urban center and unprotected.",

In Syke, the EU's Copernicus Land project produced land cover materials from the Finnish area and prepared materials describing land cover changes between 2012-2018. The data was created with two levels of accuracy: one in accordance with EU requirements and the other for national use. The material consists of a raster-format spatial database (resolution 20 * 20 m) and a vector-format spatial database, where the smallest area that stands out in the terrain is at least 25 ha and the narrowest is 100 meters. The smallest pattern in the national change data 2012-2018 is 0.5 ha and the European one is 5 ha. The material has been produced based on existing geospatial data in Syke and satellite image interpretation. The vector material was produced by generalizing the raster material in accordance with the EEA's CORINE rules.\n\nIn vector data, land use/land cover is described with a three-level hierarchical classification. The five main categories (built-up areas; agricultural areas; forests and open fabrics and rocky lands; wetlands and open marshes and water areas) are divided into a total of 15 subcategories at the second level. At the third classification level, the categories are further divided into a total of 44 subcategories. In the raster data, there are still fourth-level national categories for some categories.",

    "detailed_description": "Satellite image-based mapping of tropical forests is vital to conservation planning. Standard methods for automated image classification, however, limit classification detail in complex tropical landscapes. In this study, we first test an approach to image interpretation for mapping forest formations and land-cover on four islands of the Lesser Antilles. Secondly, we estimate the extents of land cover and protected forest by formation for five islands and examine whether cultivated areas or forest cover changed over the second half of the 20th century. The image interpretation approach stacks image mosaics with ancillary geographic data, classifying the resulting stack of raster data with decision tree software. Cloud-free image mosaics for one or two seasons were created by applying regression tree normalization to alternate scene dates to fill cloudy areas in a base scene. The approach accurately distinguished several classes that would be confused with more standard methods; the seamless mosaics aided reference data collection; and the multiseason imagery allowed us to separate drought deciduous forests and woodlands from semi-deciduous ones.\n\nCultivated land areas declined 60 to 100 percent from about 1945 to 2000 on several islands. Meanwhile, forest cover has increased 50 to 950%. Unless sugar cane cultivation becomes more profitable and competitive on the islands where it previously dominated agriculture, this trend will likely continue. Like the island of Puerto Rico, most higher-elevation forest formations are protected in formal or informal reserves. Lowland forests, however, which are drier forest types on these islands, are not well represented in reserves. Former cultivated lands in lowland areas could provide lands for new forest conservation reserves of drier forest types. The land-use history of these islands may provide insight for planners in countries currently considering lowland forest clearing for agriculture.",

J. Sci. Vol 44). The more detailed scheme is available in the file IITF_JRS2_usbvi_landcov1.img.\n\nWoody vegetation formations on the islands are subtropical and include drought deciduous xeric coastal forest and shrub with succulents, evergreen coastal shrubland, deciduous, evergreen and mixed forest and shrubland with succulents, semi-deciduous, and seasonal evergreen forests. Pasture and young leguminous secondary forest and forest shrub formations are present at lower elevations where natural and human caused disturbance including sheep and grazing has occurred.\n\nMulti-part Landsat ETM+ scenes centered around the year 2000 that had been processed for cloud and cloud shadow elimination were classified using decision tree classification software. The classification techniques use decision tree software to classify 15m panchromatic sharpened Landsat satellite image bands and ancillary geospatial data.

    "abstract": "Knowing the patterns of distribution of sediments in the global ocean is critical for understanding biogeochemical cycles and how deep-sea deposits respond to environmental change at the sea surface. We present the first digital map of seafloor lithologies based on descriptions of nearly 14,500 samples from original cruise reports, interpolated using a support vector machine algorithm. We show that sediment distribution is more complex, with significant deviations from earlier hand-drawn maps, and that major lithologies occur in drastically different proportions globally. By coupling our digital map to oceanographic data sets, we find that the global occurrence of biogenic oozes is strongly linked to specific ranges in sea-surface parameters. In particular, by using recent computations of diatom distributions from pigment-calibrated chlorophyll-a satellite data, we show that, contrary to a widely held view, diatom oozes are not a reliable proxy for surface productivity. Their global accumulation is instead strongly dependent on low surface temperature (0.9–5.7 °C) and salinity (33.8–34.0 PSS, Practical Salinity Scale 1978) and high concentrations of nutrients. Under these conditions, diatom oozes will accumulate on the seafloor regardless of surface productivity as long as there is limited competition from biogenous and detrital components, and diatom frustules are not significantly dissolved prior to preservation. Quantifying the link between the seafloor and the sea surface through the use of large digital data sets will ultimately lead to more robust reconstructions and predictions of climate change and its impact on the ocean environment.",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian Savanna, also known as Cerrado, is considered a global hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The detailed mapping of vegetation types, called physiognomies, is still a challenge due to their high spectral similarity and spatial variability. There are three major ecosystem groups (forest, savanna, and grassland), which can be hierarchically subdivided into 25 detailed physiognomies, according to a well-known classification system. We used an adapted U-net architecture to process a WorldView-2 image with 2-m spatial resolution to hierarchically classify the physiognomies of a Cerrado protected area based on deep learning techniques. Several spectral channels were tested as input datasets to classify the three major ecosystem groups (first level of classification). The dataset composed of RGB bands plus 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) achieved the best performance and was used to perform the hierarchical classification. In the first level of classification, the overall accuracy was 92.8%. On the other hand, for the savanna and grassland detailed physiognomies (second level of classification), 86.1% and 85.0% were reached, respectively. As the first work that intended to classify Cerrado physiognomies in this level of detail using deep learning, our accuracy rates outperformed others that applied traditional machine learning algorithms for this task.",

    "language": "portuguese; english",
    "abstract": "The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Latin America, extending over more than 200 million ha and hosts some of the most intensive agricultural activities for grain and beef production in the world. Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressão Cárstica do São Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piauí), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users. This opens the possibility of additional improvements of our findings by the scientific community or to be used effectively by decision makers.",

    "abstract": "Tropical cloud forests (TCFs) are one of the world’s most species- and endemism-rich terrestrial ecosystems. TCFs are threatened by direct human pressures and climate change, yet the fate of these extraordinary ecosystems remains insufficiently quantified. With discussions of the post-2020 biodiversity framework underway, TCFs are a defining test case of the success and promise of recent policy targets and their associated mechanisms to avert the global biodiversity crisis. Here we present a global assessment of the recent status and trends of TCFs and their biodiversity and evaluate the efficacy of current protection measures. We find that cloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection. Increased conservation efforts are needed to avert the impending regional or global demise of TCFs and their unique biodiversity.",

We developed seasonal paddy rice maps at high resolution (10 m) for Bangladesh and Northeast India, typical cloud-prone regions in South Asia, using cloud-free Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1 satellite, the Random Forest classifier, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The maps were provided for all the three distinct rice growing seasons of the region: Boro, Aus and Aman. The paddy rice maps were evaluated against the independent validation samples, and compared with the existing products from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The generated paddy rice maps were spatially consistent with the compared maps and had a satisfactory accuracy over 90%. This study showed the potential of Sentinel-1 data and GEE on large scale paddy rice mapping in cloud-prone regions like tropical Asia.",

The resolution of the distribution maps is 20-m in Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia, and 10-m in the other provinces. The distribution maps are produced using the time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. The overall accuracy over 21 provincial administrative regions was 85.23 % on average based on 108195 samples, and the average R2 was 0.83 over three years compared with county-level statistical planting areas.classification system: 0: non-single-season rice 1: single-season rice Updates: v1.1: Compared with the distribution map of double-season rice from Pan et al.'s dataset (2021) (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13224609), the two datasets overlapped in provinces where both single- and double-season rice were cultivated, including Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangxi.

Training data encompassed three classes: seagrass, non-seagrass (including coral reefs, mangroves, sand/rubble, and macroalgal beds), and optical-deep water (ODW), totaling 25,463 training pixels. Important: the classification output is a binary (seagrass/non-seagrass) class. Validation of the map was conducted independently using 1,019 in-situ field survey points collected from 2017-2023. Mapping accuracy was assessed through an error matrix. Overall accuracy = 82%",

    "abstract": "The Ecosystem base map provides full spatial coverage of the country. Although the mapping of agricultural and urban ecosystems was also a goal, the primary target areas were areas closer to nature. During the preparation of the basic map, a \"bottom-up\" mapping model was implemented, which on the one hand relies on already existing thematic databases that reflect the real situation as much as possible, and on the other hand supplements and clarifies them based on remote sensing methods. An important aspect was the use of regularly updated databases, thus creating the possibility of updating the map in the future. The base year is 2015, but the range of databases used also includes Sentinel optical and radar space images for the year 2017. The studies establishing the methodology, and then the mapping itself, as consortium partners of the nature conservation project, are the remote sensing and geoinformatics departments of the Lechner Knowledge Center (as the legal successor of the Earth Survey and Remote Sensing Institute, FÖMI), the Ecology and Botany Institute of the Ecological Research Center (ÖK ÖBI) and the Agricultural Science Research Center Soil and Agrochemistry It was carried out by the staff of the Institute (ATK TAKI) with the support and professional supervision of the Department of Nature Conservation (AM TMF) of the Ministry of Agriculture - as project coordinator.",
    "detailed_description": "In order to develop version 4.0 of the Ecosystem Basemap, we implemented an increasingly widespread \"bottom-up\" mapping model during the preparation of land cover and land use maps. Among the databases with spatial relevance reviewed for the solution of the task, we used the LPIS land cover layer as a basis, due to its national coverage and its relatively high thematic and spatial resolution for a significant part of the country. To complement this, additional databases with different thematic focus were used (e.g. Copernicus High Resolution Land Cover Layers (HRL) Water and Wetness (WAW) layer for reference year 2015; Forest Information System (ESZIR) data) and we put great emphasis on the own processing of data collected by remote sensing methods during the production of otherwise data-deficient topics (e.g. different types of lawns). The resulting data were organized into a theoretical cube with uniform geometry (20 meter raster) and projection (ETRS1989 LAEA), then purposeful, cell-based queries (Python based) were used to generate the individual result categories and thus the basemap (in GeoTiff format). The basemap, considered quasi-final, was subjected to a thematic quality review, the experiences and results of which provided further input for the final clarifications. Regarding the result layer, it is important to note that its scale can be characterized by spatial and thematic accuracy determined by the source databases, which may vary from thematic class to topic, and in fact the 20 x 20 meter grid geometry can only be considered as a representation resolution. The Ecosystem Basemap is made up of six main categories. \n\n1. The boundaries of the main category artificial surfaces (Urban) are mainly provided by the artificial land cover elements of the LPIS land cover database (e.g. settlements, farmsteads, industrial areas, mines, landfills, transport infrastructure, etc.). Its filling with detailed geometry and thematic content was ensured by thematic databases (e.g. road database, altitude model) and remote sensing results based on Sentinel space images (primarily in the separation of built and green areas). \n2. The boundaries of the main category Croplands are also defined in the LPIS FSB. database elements. Content is also uploaded by the LPIS. database, additional information was provided by the VINGIS database, and in some areas ESZIR-OEA also helped us. \n3. The boundaries of the main category Grasslands and other herbaceous vegetation are mainly defined in the LPIS FSB. database containing grasslands, but also includes clearings included in the ESIROEA database. The strengthening of grassland boundaries and the diversification of the category were solved at the first level by analyzing remotely sensed images and using a learning algorithm (treating the main category together with wetlands in this respect). For this, time series of Sentinel space images (optical 71 and radar), spectral indices derived from them, topographic indices derived from DDM (baseline data) and reference data (NER maps, certain LPIS fsb. categories, permanent turf overlay, etc.) were used. Further diversification was carried out on the basis of expert estimates of limit values for soil parameters. Due to the lack of a proper baseline database on grassland types at national level, there may be confusion between third-level subcategories, with some categories underestimating or overestimating their occurrences. \n4. The main category forests and other woodlands are delimited on the basis of the forest stock repository (OEA) of the Forest Administration Information System (ESZIR), which is supplemented both territorially and in content by woody land cover that is not covered by the ESIR-OEA, but may have woody land cover based on other data sources (e.g. LPIS fsb., remote sensing results) (the latter are categorized as \"woody vegetation n.e.c.). The subcategories were filled with content by experts taking into account the descriptive data of the ESIR.\n5. The boundaries of the main category Wetlands are defined in the LPIS FSB. It is given by classes of certain grasslands, other categories of herbaceous vegetation and wetlands. Patches of arable land that are intermittently wet, but otherwise under cultivation, are not included in this category. The demarcation was carried out according to the method described under the main category \"Grasslands and other herbaceous vegetation\". The separation of woody subclasses is ensured by the database of ESZIR-OEA. \n6. In the development of the main category Rivers and lakes, the LPIS fsb. database, the 2015 Waters and wetlands (WAW) Copernicus High Resolution Layer (HRL) permanent water surfaces category and remote sensing results were involved. (Water surfaces identified exclusively by remote sensing are classified as standing waters.) \n\nAs a consequence of semi-automatic processing, we assumed a slight mixing between the subcategories of the completed Ecosystem base map, so we considered it important to check the map thematically. \n\nThe following methods were chosen: \n(1) comparison with databases with similar topics, \n(2) visual inspection by external experts (\"Look & feel\" check), and systematic verification and accuracy checking \n(3). The result of a preliminary comparison with the reference data shows that the present version of the NÖSZTÉP basemap is \"strong\" primarily where the LPIS is a basic data: the delimitation of agricultural areas. The slightly lower accuracy of the other categories is due to several factors, which are summarised in general terms as follows: \n\nErrors accumulated during the production of the basic data and reference data (mapping methodology, accuracy, impact of possible pre- and post-processing methods, e.g. noise cancellation, etc.). \n\nErrors resulting from differences in thematic and spatial resolution between the basic data and the reference data, as well as distortions resulting from conversion steps required for integration into the common data model. \n\nDifference between the time aspect of the basic data and the reference data. \n\nShortcoming of core databases. \n\nThematic breakdown of existing national but profession-specific basic data and differences due to thematic requirements of the target database. \n\nMethodological errors in the query rule line. \n\nDespite the errors described above, the completed Ecosystem Basemap can be considered as the first, operational, nationwide implementation of new map data generation using bottom-up, cube-based data integration and remote sensing tools, carried out with the utmost care.",

    "abstract": "NatureServe ecologists lead efforts to develop internationally standardized classifications for terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation.  One classification approach is terrestrial ecological systems, mid- to local- scale ecological units useful for standardized mapping and conservation assessments of habitat diversity and landscape conditions. Each ecological system type describes complexes of plant communities influenced by similar physical environments and dynamic ecological processes (like fire or flooding). The classification defines some 800 units across the United States and has provided an effective means of mapping ecological concepts at regional/national scales in greater detail than was previously possible.",
    "detailed_description": "Standardized ecological classification units form the foundation for effective data collection, assessment, and reporting on ecosystems.  NatureServe described over 800 mid-local-scale classification units from across the United States. These “terrestrial ecological system’’ units are described using multiple plant communities that tend to co-occur based on recurrent similarities in environmental setting and ecological dynamics.  For example, a given forest or grassland system will describe the predominant plant species composition, landforms, soils, drainage, and natural disturbance dynamics.  Wetland or riparian ecological systems will have similar descriptions, and reference the characteristic hydrologic regime.  All types include a description of their known distribution (e.g., by country, state, and ecoregion).\nBy integrating environmental setting and dynamic ecological processes with vegetation into the concept of each unit, this classification system lends itself to biophysical modeling and robust characterization of wildlife habitat. These units apply well to land cover mapping and may be augmented with modifiers for specific variants in composition and structure resulting in robust, standardized maps. The inter-agency LANDFIRE effort in the United States uses these concepts to develop conceptual “state-and-transition” models to characterize wildfire regimes.  That effort also produces maps of potential/historical and current distribution for most types nationwide. NatureServe maintains national and regional maps of terrestrial ecological system units. Since vegetation types are used in type description, terrestrial ecological system units provide a direct, systematic link to the US National and International Vegetation Classification.  They also provide a useful framework for integration with land-based “ecological site” concepts and descriptions, as used in the United States for forest and rangeland management applications.",

    "abstract": "In order to support continental-scale assessment of terrestrial ecosystem distribution and condition, we developed a distribution map of the potential location and extent of vegetation types for North America, Meso America, and the Caribbean. NatureServe ecologists lead efforts to develop internationally standardized classifications for terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation. One classification approach is with existing vegetation. The International Vegetation Classification, or EcoVeg approach (Faber-Langendoen et al. in press), grew out of USA federal standards, defining vegetation concepts at multiple thematic levels. Vegetation systems are defined as “moderate sets of diagnostic plant species and diagnostic growth forms that reflect biogeographic differences in composition and sub-continental to regional differences in mesoclimate, geology, substrates, hydrology, and disturbance regimes.” Building from prior national and regional ecological classifications from the area (see Josse et al. 2003; 2007), a hierarchical classification was established for existing vegetation types describing natural upland and wetland conditions. National and regional maps of current extent were reconciled to the standard classification and provided georeferenced locations for use in spatial modeling. Spatial modeling used climate, geophysical data layers, and satellite spectral data, in a sequential process to map potential distributions at several levels of the vegetation classification hierarchy. Inductive modeling in sequential steps, followed by expert review and refinement, resulted in a map of 147 vegetation macrogroups for the North American continent & the Caribbean. This map depicts the location and extent of each macrogroup had there been no intensive human land uses in recent centuries. Initial validation of the map, using a separate, randomized set of labeled sample areas of 0.5km2vs. 1km2vs. 5km2 indicated high agreement at finest spatial resolutions, suggesting that the map is suitable for use in applications requiring a pixel resolution of 270 x 270m2and higher.",

These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS designed a new generation of NLCD products released in 2016. This innovation continues with design and processing improvements through 2021 and aims to provide consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2021 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in streamlined processes for integrating specialized MRLC partner data along with numerous new datasets, assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and machine learning based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated operational system incorporating AI/ML technologies for NLCD 2021 production. These processes resulted in a five percent increase in accuracy from the 2011 product for an overall Level II & I Overall accuracy (OA) 86.4% & 90.6% in the NLCD 2016 release.

The stratification produced 3,923 terrestrial ecological land units (ELUs) at a base resolution of 250 meters. The ELUs were derived from data on land surface features in a three step approach. The first step involved acquiring or developing four global raster datalayers representing the primary components of ecosystem structure: bioclimate, landform, lithology, and land cover. These datasets generally represent the most accurate, current, globally comprehensive, and finest spatial and thematic resolution data available for each of the four inputs. The second step involved a spatial combination of the four inputs into a single, new integrated raster dataset where every cell represents a combination of values from the bioclimate, landforms, lithology, and land cover datalayers. This foundational global raster datalayer, called ecological facets (EFs), contains 47,650 unique combinations of the four inputs. The third step involved an aggregation of the EFs into the 3,923 ELUs.",

    "abstract": "The existence, sources, distribution, circulation, and physicochemical nature of macro-scale oceanic water bodies have long been a focus of oceanographic inquiry. Building on that work, this paper describes an objectively derived and globally comprehensive set of 37 distinct volumetric region units, called ecological marine units (EMUs). They are constructed on a regularly spaced ocean point-mesh grid, from sea surface to seafloor, and attributed with data from the 2013 World Ocean Atlas version 2.",
    "detailed_description": "The point attribute data are the means of the decadal averages from a 57-year climatology of six physical and chemical environment parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and silicate). The database includes over 52 million points that depict the global ocean in x, y, and z dimensions. The point data were statistically clustered to define the 37 EMUs, which represent physically and chemically distinct water volumes based on spatial variation in the six marine environmental characteristics used. The aspatial clustering to produce the 37 EMUs did not include point location or depth as a determinant, yet strong geographic and vertical separation was observed. Twenty-two of the 37 EMUs are globally or regionally extensive, and account for 99% of the ocean volume, while the remaining 15 are smaller and shallower, and occur around coastal features. We assessed the vertical distribution of EMUs in the water column and placed them into classical depth zones representing epipelagic (0 m to 200 m), mesopelagic (200 m to 1,000 m), bathypelagic (1,000 m to 4,000 m) and abyssopelagic (>4,000 m) layers. The mapping and characterization of the EMUs represent a new spatial framework for organizing and understanding the physical, chemical, and ultimately biological properties and processes of oceanic water bodies. The EMUs are an initial objective partitioning of the ocean using long-term historical average data, and could be extended in the future by adding new classification variables and by introducing functionality to develop time-specific EMU distribution maps. The EMUs are an open-access resource, and as both a standardized geographic framework and a baseline physicochemical characterization of the oceanic environment, they are intended to be useful for disturbance assessments, ecosystem accounting exercises, conservation priority setting, and marine protected area network design, along with other research and management applications.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "The distributions of different ecosystems, from lowland rainforests to alpine wetlands, are a key component of global biodiversity. Accordingly, comprehensive and detailed information on ecosystem distributions in space and their changes through time is urgently needed to support the monitoring framework of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as many other vital applications in science, policy, and management. To address this need, we here present a suite of national indicators of ecosystem-specific annual areas and areal changes. These indicators are based on the GlobES (Global EcoSystems) data cube, which maps the per-pixel areas of >70 terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic ecosystems annually since 1992 at a high spatial resolution. GlobES builds on recent progress in multi-decadal environmental mapping, integrating state-of-the-art information on land cover and land use, climate, geomorphology, hydrology, and various other environmental factors. For immediate applicability in conservation practice, the ecosystem types correspond to the habitat class scheme of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nExtensive validation of the GlobES data cube against millions of ecosystem and species records has shown high overall accuracies (F1-score of 88%) that, however, vary across different regions and ecosystem types. To allow users to factor that uncertainty into their evaluations of ecosystem status and trends, the presented national ecosystem indicators will soon be associated with uncertainty bars, calculated by aggregating the spatiotemporally detailed uncertainty estimates determined for the GlobES ecosystem maps. As the number of available validation records will continue to increase rapidly, the detail and reliability of the GlobES data and of the associated uncertainties will further improve over the coming years. To allow these improvements to also enhance the precision and reliability of ecosystem monitoring, the national ecosystem indicators and their uncertainty bars will be periodically updated.\n\nThe GlobES ecosystem data cube currently undergoes final updates, before the final, fully documented datasets will be published as an open-access resource. To already facilitate discussions and planning, preliminary time series of the GlobES-based national ecosystem indicators are currently made available for exploration and download via this website. However, please note that until the finalization of the GlobES data is announced here, the provided indicator information should be considered preliminary and is not yet fit-for-purpose for official applications in science or policy.",

    "abstract": "We provide a global spatially explicit characterization of 47 (version 001) terrestrial habitat types, as defined in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme, which is widely used in ecological analyses, including for assessing species’ Area of Habitat. We produced this novel habitat map by creating a global decision tree that intersects the best currently available global data on land cover, climate and land use. The maps broaden our understanding of habitats globally, assist in constructing area of habitat (AOH) refinements and are relevant for broad-scale ecological studies and future IUCN Red List assessments. We hope that these data and outlined framework will spur further development of biodiversity-relevant habitat maps at global scales. An interactive interface helping to navigate the map can be found at on the Naturemap website ( https://explorer.naturemap.earth/map).\n\nProvided is the code to recreate the map (to made available soon), the global composite image at native -100m Copernicus resolution for level 1 and level 2 and layers of aggregated fractional cover (unit: [0-1] * 1000) at 1km for level 1 and level 2.\n\nStarting with version 004 there changemasks for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are supplied. Changemasks for the composite masks show the changed grid cells and their new values with earlier years being nested in later years, e.g. using the changemask for 2019 includes all changes up to 2019. For the fractional cover estimates at ~1km resolution, new fractional cover changemasks are supplied as subtraction (before - after) between the previous and current year (unit range: [-1 to 1] * 1000).\n\nWe highlight that only changes in land cover are considered since most of the ancillary layers (e.g. pasture, forest management, climate, etc...) are static and thus not all changes in habitats can be found. We therefore recommend end users to continue using the 2015 dataset unless specific habitat updates to habitat are needed.",

    "abstract": "The following set of data corresponds to the evaluation and identification of the threat status of the remaining ecosystems of Colombia, applying the methodology of the Red List of Ecosystems developed by the IUCN-International Union for Conservation of Nature (Keith et al. 2013 ). The information is built from the different criteria established by the IUCN that allow evidence of the risk of collapse of ecosystems, which is measured through the reduction in geographical distribution, the degradation of key processes and biotic components. The evaluation process included criteria A, B, C and D, the result of which made it possible to identify that of the 81 remaining ecosystems, 22 are classified as in CRITICAL status, 14 are IN DANGER, 12 ecosystems are VULNERABLE and the remaining 33 are in LESS CONCERN.\n\nThe database \"ListaRojaEcosistemasColombia.gdb\" is made up of 2 feature datasets \"ListaRojaEcosistemasColombia\" and \"EcosistemasRemantesColombia\". The feature dataset \"ListaRojaEcosistemasColombia\" is made up of a feature class called \"Evalaluación_LRE\", this layer is the result of the application of the methodology, where the following criteria were evaluated: A (Subcriteria: A1, A2b and A3), B (Subcriteria : B1ai, B1aii, B1aiii, B2ai, B2aii and B2aiii), C (Subcriterion: C2) and D (Subcriteria: D1, D2 and D3). The final threat category of each ecosystem was recorded in the \"Final Ev\" field. The scale of the layer is 1:100,000 and consists of 81 polygons showing the remaining areas of the potential ecosystems of Colombia generated by Etter et al. (2015a). The identification code of each ecosystem \"COD\" corresponds to the same code that identifies the Potential Ecosystems of Colombia (Etter et al. 2015a), a layer found in the other feature dataset called \"EcosistemasRemantesColombia\".",

The information was produced in digital format, from 1997 to 2017, based on the compilation of existing data, interpretation of orbital images, field expeditions and bibliographic research. The vector product is made available with complementary tabular information on the classification. The methods used in the mapping are described in the IBGE's Technical Manual of Brazilian Vegetation.",
    "detailed_description": "This product comes from the IBGE's Natural Resources Mapping (MRN) activity, which consists of the production, compilation, storage and dissemination of information related to Geology, Geomorphology, Pedology and Vegetation. This activity began with the incorporation, in 1986, into IBGE of the technical-scientific collection and the team of professionals from the RADAM and RADAMBRASIL projects, executed by the Brazilian government in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1997, through the contract with the Commission for the Implementation of the Airspace Control System (CISCEA), the managing unit of the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) implementation project, which is an integral part of Censipam (Management and Operational Center for the Amazon Protection System), the publication of existing information for the Legal Amazon began. Between 2004 and 2017, the activity was developed for the rest of the country, through several internal IBGE projects. In a complementary manner, information from other projects was incorporated, with the institution's participation, such as environmental diagnoses and zoning and forest inventories, carried out in specific locations within the national territory.\n\nThroughout the production period, the material was published in cartographic sections corresponding to the International Millionth Map – CIM, and stored in the BDiA (Environmental Information Database). This database contains the vector features that make up the thematic mapping of natural resources, as well as georeferenced points with complementary environmental information, compiled or collected during the work. From 2018 onwards, the data was made available for the entire national territory, in the format of a continuous thematic database.\n\nThe cartographic boundaries in the published material underwent changes during the production period, due to methodological corrections and updates. The mapping methods were adapted according to the availability of inputs and resources used in each stage of the work. With scientific and technological advances in knowledge of the types of vegetation in Brazil, the classification was reevaluated, with the inclusion and simplification of land cover classes.\n\nAfter each sheet was prepared to the nearest millionth, it was made compatible with the adjacent mapped areas, until the entire national territory was mapped in 2017. In that year, the country's boundaries were updated, according to the Continuous Cartographic Base of Brazil at a scale of 1:250,000 (BC250), resulting in some changes to the mapped areas. New revisions were made during the execution of the project “Biomes and Coastal-Marine System of Brazil (scale 1:250,000)”, published in 2019, mainly in the border areas between the Biomes.\n\nProcess step\n1. Selection of pre-existing mappings and auxiliary bibliographic material. 2. Selection and acquisition of images from orbital/airborne sensors. 3. Digital image processing. 4. Preliminary interpretation of images. 5. Field expedition. 6. Reinterpretation of images. 7. Compatibility of mapping between adjacent areas. 8. Editing, topological validation and storage in BDiA. 9. Periodic dissemination of data. 10. Continuous updates and corrections.",

Several habitat manuals were used to create a satellite classification system in order to produce a total of 54 different natural and man-made mapping categories at a very fine level of detail, with 41 terrestrial and 13 marine habitat categories. Land Use and Land Cover mapping was also derived from the imagery. Examples of the groundbreaking habitat maps are shown within this book, highlighting areas of critical ecological importance. \n\nIn addition to continuous coverage of the entire Abu Dhabi land mass, satellites have been used to map marine areas to water depths of 15 metres. For the very first time at a large scale an accurate understanding now exists of the extent of the Emirate’s most fragile habitats. Such information can be combined with other important Environment Agency- Abu Dhabi data sets to assist in conservation and preservation activities of endangered species. \n\nUsing change detection techniques it is now possible to update the baseline mapping in rapid time. The loss or gain of critical habitats can be better detected, which in turn can help decision makers to understand how effective environmental policy measures have been. A new method has been introduced and documented enabling repeatability in order to understand long term trends in changes to habitats. Extensive ground truthing was undertaken to validate the accuracy of the final map (terrestrial habitats were validated to 90% accuracy and marine habitats to 83%).",

    "abstract": "The Mapping Biodiversity Priorities Project is a practical, science-based approach to national biodiversity assessment that can provide information to inform a range of policies, strategies and action plans. The rapid spatial biodiversity assessment that reveals where the biodiversity of the country is found, what state it is in and how it could be prioritised. \n\nThe Mapping Biodiversity Priorities (SANBI and UNEP-WCMC, 2016) approach is a systematic conservation planning approach based on 3 principles:\n\n- The principle of representation is about ensuring that a sample of every species and every ecosystem type is protected or managed for conservation in some way. This avoids the common historical bias towards conserving certain charismatic species, or towards placing protected areas in places where there happen to be few competing land uses, so that only certain species and ecosystem types end up being protected. \n- The principle of persistence is to conserve the key ecological processes that are essential for ensuring that ecosystems and species can persist over time. This can include, for example, keeping ecological corridors intact that allow for species movement and connectivity in the landscape. \n- The third principle is to set quantitative biodiversity targets that guide how much biodiversity should be conserved. These targets underpin both the assessment and the prioritisation process. They can also be used to evaluate the success or impact of conservation actions.\n\nThe Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) under the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism and with the technical guidance of the University of Botswana, the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) as well as the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) used this approach to develop maps of ecosystem types, ecological condition, ecosystem threat status and ecosystem protection level. These maps support the development of National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) and help prioritise implementation (NBSAP, 2015). They can also feed into national planning, policies and sectoral frameworks to ensure that development does not erode a nation’s natural capital. Phase One of the Mapping Biodiversity Priorities (MBP) project (2017 –2019) laid the foundation for mainstreaming of spatial biodiversity information into government decision making processes in Botswana. Integrated baseline layers were generated and used to conduct spatial biodiversity assessments of ecosystem threat status and protection level. Stakeholder meetings were convened to validate the products and entry points for mainstreaming the assessment products were identified. Phase Two (2020-2021) of the Mapping Biodiversity Priorities project is focused on integrating SBA products into the State of the Environment Report.",

    "abstract": "In Ethiopia, rapid Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (SBA) was conducted in the MBP Project Phase I in 2018/2019. The headline results and outcomes of this phase include spatial data and maps which include maps of ecosystem type, protected areas and other effective means (PAs and OEM) ecosystem condition, and the assessment results, namely: maps of ecosystem threat status and ecosystem protection level. Moreover, the socio-economic data of stakeholders mapping and mainstreaming entry points were identified.\n\nThis Project offered unique opportunity to conduct spatial biodiversity assessments and to engage with a range of stakeholders that support development of evidence based Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (SBA) that enables exploration of sectoral synergies, trade-offs and policy impacts which in turn will improve the country’s technical capacity to curate, analyse and present spatial information, and capability to use it to integrate biodiversity issues into other sectors and national development processes such as transformative National Biodiversity and Strategy and Action Planning (NBSAP), and implementation. The Project also demonstrated the value of spatial data collection, curation and analysis to produce information products that can inform policy processes.\n\nSouth African Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) and Dr. Stephen Holness (a technical lead from Nelson Mandela University) were partners of the Project that provided critical technical support, and Japan Biodiversity Fund (JBF) was the source fund through Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD). First and Second Stakeholder Workshops were conducted with kind financial support from Mainstreaming Incentives for Biodiversity Conservation Project which is housed in Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission.\n\nNational Spatial Biodiversity Assessment (NSBA) was the first comprehensive national spatial assessment of the state of biodiversity, covering terrestrial, aquatic and wetland environments. It introduced two new headline indicators for assessing the state of Ethiopia’s biodiversity, namely: ecosystem threat status (referred to as ecosystem status), and ecosystem protection level. Ecosystem threat status informs how threatened the ecosystems or habitat types are, and ecosystem protection level indicates how well- or under-protected the ecosystems or habitat types are. These indicators are primary indicators that provide an overview of ecosystem state and will require further refinement in the future. Furthermore, the MBP approach creates opportunity to the country to develop the web-based online geo-portal platform to upload the NSBA products and supports the mechanisms for monitoring and reviewing implementation of the NBSAP.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "A new fine scale map of Rwanda’s ecosystems was developed, which identified 29 ecosystems across 9 biomes.",
    "detailed_description": "The recent Rwanda landcover map (Esri Rwanda Ltd., 2018) was the primary input into the ecological condition map. It is a useful starting point but has a number of issues. Although urban areas are well covered, individual buildings and even villages in rural areas are often below the resolution of the dataset. Roads are not mapped.  In a number of cases natural and severely or irreversibly modified areas are combined in a single category. For example, natural forests and artificial (human-planted) forest plantations are a single category; dams and lakes are not distinguished from each other; and natural open areas and open ground are not distinguished from impacted land cover classes. Some natural landcover classes are misidentified as impacted classes; for example, large areas of alpine herbaceous vegetation within Volcanoes NP are mapped as agriculture. Therefore, for the SBA analysis the ecological condition map was produced based on the best available data from the landcover and several additional sources: \n\n• Selected landcover classes were used from the land use /land cover map (Esri Rwanda Ltd., 2018). These were: Permanent and seasonal agriculture & Settlements and buildings (covering urban areas, including industrial and mining areas). \n• Point data on buildings (especially useful for rural villages and households in farmland) and data on settlement areas were collated from the OpenStreetMap data (Open Street Map, 2022a).  \n• Roads data on roads and tracks were collated from the OpenStreetMap data (Open Street Map, 2022b). \n• Selected landcover classes, such as coffee, were specifically mapped in the erosion mapping dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2020). \n• Dams were identified from the Rwandan toposheet data (Rwanda Surveys and Mapping, 2022b). \n• Plantations (Eucalyptus and Pine), including small woodlots were mapped from the 2019 forest dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2019). \n• Alien bamboo areas from the 2019 forest dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2019). \n• Tea plantations were mapped from a slightly older but high quality spatial dataset (National Agricultural Export Development Board, 2016). \n\nTo reduce misclassification, natural areas were identified from a number of data sources. These were used to over-ride more general data from the land use/ land cover dataset (Esri Rwanda Ltd., 2018): \n• Natural forest specifically mapped in the 2019 forest dataset (Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2019). \n• Data on intact natural wetlands from the 2016 SWAM wetlands dataset (Rwanda Water Resources Board, 2016) was used to identify intact natural areas of wetlands.  \n• It was assumed that high altitude herbaceous alpine areas within national parks were natural rather than agricultural lands. This was based on a combination of the draft ecosystem map (SANBI, 2022) and the Protected Areas dataset (IUCN, 2021; Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2022a). \n• It was assumed that the fine scale ecosystems specifically mapped and identified for gazetting as protected ecosystems are natural (Biodiversity Conservation, Environmental Management and Rural Development, 2015; Rwanda Ministry of Environment, 2022b).  \n\nThe various datasets were integrated as follows: \n• Where there are known natural areas mapped from specific and accurate datasets (i.e. the forest, wetland, Protected Area and protected ecosystems layers), these took priority. These areas were classified as “Natural or Near Natural”. Areas that were not specifically mapped as “Not Natural” were assumed to be “Natural or Near Natural”.   \n• Small scale or detailed datasets (e.g. buildings and roads) of “Not Natural” types trumped other more broadly mapped landcover classes. Specifically mapped agricultural or cultivated features trumped other more broadly mapped land use classes. These specially mapped features were tea, bamboo, coffee, artificial plantations and dams. Selected general categories from the Rwanda ESRI landcover were used in areas not otherwise mapped as another landcover class. These were permanent and seasonal agriculture, settlements, industry and mining. \n• After the integration of the two above steps, a GIS based fragmentation analysis was undertaken to identify very small (under 2 ha) areas of isolated areas that had not been specifically mapped as “Natural or Near natural”. We assumed that these very small areas were likely to be highly degraded and hence were reclassified as “Not Natural”.\n\nThe analysis highlighted that only 28.3% of Rwanda is likely to be in “Natural or Near Natural” ecological condition.  Importantly, this is a rapid initial analysis: \n• The mapping is largely based on the assumption that anywhere that is not specifically mapped as “Not Natural” is in fact “Natural or Near Natural”. Even with the correction for highly fragmented areas, this is likely to significantly underestimate actual levels of landscape transformation. \n• There is no specific mapping of landscape degradation (e.g. alien invasive vegetation or overgrazing), and no direct mapping of processes that cause degradation of aquatic ecosystems (e.g. pollution). This will result in underestimation of actual threat levels in these ecosystem types. \n• The areas identified as fragmented may include important natural areas. Although the analysis is likely to be broadly accurate, the results should not be used for site level decisions without robust field verification of results. \n\nVerification and improvement of the ecological condition map should be the focus for any updated assessment. It will result in significantly improved results at a site level. However, it should be noted that the overall pattern of results is likely to be robust.",

    "detailed_description": "The GBR10 benthic habitat type map is the output of a modelling process that combines satellite imagery and other environmental attributes like water depth, slope and wave climate, along with known occurrences of benthic habitat type. The occurrences of benthic habitat type were derived through machine learning applied to geolocated photos of the benthos (>100,000 photos) that were collected along reef flats and reef slopes at various offshore shallow reefs (~100 reefs). The modelling process involves taking those occurrences of benthic habitat at known locations (training data) and using a machine learning model to build a relationship between benthic habitat type and the underlying data layers (imagery, depth, slope, waves). Because the data layers cover the whole Great Barrier Reef, a prediction is then able to be made for benthic habitat across the whole Great Barrier Reef as well. Contextual editing was then used to make changes to the map, based on a set of geomorphology- and ecology-based rules, such as what environment a class can occur in and what classes are able to neighbour each other (object-based rulesets). This map covers the “offshore” or “mid and outer-shelf” reefs of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Some of the occurrences of benthic habitat type are withheld from the process, and used to check how well the mapping performed at the end (validation). The mapping was carried out by the Remote Sensing Research Centre at the University of Queensland.",

    "abstract": "Detailed parcel-level crop type mapping for the whole European Union (EU) is necessary for the evaluation of agricultural policies. The Copernicus program, and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99 (rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here can underpin the operational delivery of in-season high-resolution based crop mapping.",

Please note that no farmer reported data are derivable from the Cropland Data Layer.",
    "detailed_description": "The 2008 to current CDLs have a spatial resolution of 30 meters and were produced using moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery. The current program uses Landsat 8 and 9 OLI/TIRS and ESA SENTINEL-2A and -2B collected throughout the growing season. Past years of CDL have used other satellite-based sensors such as Landsat 5 and 7, ISRO ResourceSat-2 LISS-3, IRS AWiFS, Diemos-1 and UK-DMC-2, and MODIS 16-Day NDVI Composite. Some CDL states used additional ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the land cover classification including historical CDL data, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), USDA National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI), and the most current versions of the USGS National Land Cover Database imperviousness and the tree canopy data layers. Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. Some CDL states incorporate additional crop-specific ground reference obtained from the following non-FSA sources which are detailed in the 'Lineage' Section of this metadata: US Bureau of Reclamation, NASS Citrus Data Layer (internal use only), California Department of Water Resources, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Office of Agricultural Water Policy, Cornell University grape/vineyard data, Oregon State University tree crop and vineyard data, Utah Department of Water Resources, and Washington State Department of Agriculture.

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "Irrigation accounts for 70% of global water use by humans and 33–40% of global food production comes from irrigated croplands. Accurate and timely information related to global irrigation is therefore needed to manage increasingly scarce water resources and to improve food security in the face of yield gaps, climate change and extreme events such as droughts, floods, and heat waves. Unfortunately, this information is not available for many regions of the world. This study aims to improve characterization of global rain-fed, irrigated and paddy croplands by integrating information from national and sub-national surveys, remote sensing, and gridded climate data sets. To achieve this goal, we used supervised classification of remote sensing, climate, and agricultural inventory data to generate a global map of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands. We estimate that 314 million hectares (Mha) worldwide were irrigated circa 2005. This includes 66 Mha of irrigated paddy cropland and 249 Mha of irrigated non-paddy cropland. Additionally, we estimate that 1047 Mha of cropland are managed under rain-fed conditions, including 63 Mha of rain-fed paddy cropland and 985 Mha of rain-fed non-paddy cropland. More generally, our results show that global mapping of irrigated, rain-fed, and paddy croplands is possible by combining information from multiple data sources. However, regions with rapidly changing irrigation or complex mixtures of irrigated and non-irrigated crops present significant challenges and require more and better data to support high quality mapping of irrigation.",

    "title": "Main ecosystems in Norway - version 1",
    "language": "norwegian",
    "abstract": "The dataset shows a first version of a main ecosystem map for Norway. The map is based on a combination of the land resource map AR50 (NIBIO) and selected data from topographical map N50 (Statens kartverk). The classification system for the ecosystem map is based on the highest hierarchical level (level 1) in Eurostat's ecosystem typology from May 2023. The map has a minimum figure size of 15 da. The Norwegian Environment Agency and NIBIO have collaborated on the development and production of main ecosystem maps for Norway, with help from NINA to assess the ecosystem links in the map. The basis for the work is, among other things, laid in the feasibility study \"Map of Norwegian main ecosystems - a feasibility study\" (NINA Report 2055), a separate concept study by the Norwegian Environment Agency and a test version (MVP) published in early summer 2023 (NIBIO Report 088/2023).",
    "detailed_description": "The main ecosystem map 1.0 is not the result of a separate mapping, but is produced by combining and recoding information from existing maps. These maps are designed according to different specifications than Eurostat's ecosystem typology, and the classes in the main ecosystem map in version 1.0 therefore correspond to varying degrees with the European ecosystem typology. This is made visible to some extent by adapting the Norwegian names of the classes to the actual content, but the names can still be perceived as imprecise. A thorough review of the content of the classes is described in OWNER/CONTACT PERSON NIBIO report no 143, 2023. The purpose of this product is to establish a comprehensive ecosystem map for Norway with a known methodology and an agreed typology. This first version will have shortcomings and weaknesses that will be worked on to solve in future versions. The map must contribute to the best possible knowledge base for decisions about land use, including spatial planning and business practice. The data set has been established in line with the Storting's processing of Meld.St. 14 (2015-2016) Nature for life. The data set is suitable for use in all types of planning and land management tasks, but the degree of generalization in the map means that the map is best suited on a regional scale and provides the most accurate information in the scale range 1:20000 to 1:50000. The generalization in the map corresponds to the generalization in AR50, where a rule-based automated process is used, which means that AR50 is significantly simplified and changed compared to the basic data included. (See Strand and Moum 2000 and Heggem et al. 2019 for a detailed description of the generalization methodology). NIBIO therefore recommends that AR50, and thus also this map, is mainly used for visualization of the area classes over larger areas, and not for area statistics with high demands on precision, change analyzes or for local (detailed) planning purposes.",

To produce these maps, we use artificial intelligence processes and more particularly deep learning. These maps are then called “prediction” because they are obtained from a digital AI model which statistically estimates for each pixel its membership in a class, and may not exhaustively reflect the reality on the ground.

    "detailed_description": "Methodological developments have started several years ago at CESBIO, and promising tests have been carried out on LANDSAT data covering the far south of France, from Bayonne to Perpignan, and on SPOT4 data (Take5). The methods were tested extensively as part of the S2 Agri project for which 12 sites around the world were treated in 2014, then 3 entire countries and 5 300*300 sites will be treated in 2016. The good rate classification target is 90%. The CES member laboratories are also leading a TOSCA project financed by the CNES in which methodological development activities are carried out (validation and adaptation for a generic nomenclature). The methods and tools developed in this framework will therefore be applicable to France. The method used being supervised, the work must be supplemented by an ambitious campaign to acquire reference data, making it possible to carry out learning and validation of the product. Contacts have been established with potential users (MEDDE SOeS, CEREMA, INRA-ODR, etc.) to establish partnerships for data provision, validation of specifications and validation of product quality. The methods developed could now benefit from support for capitalization within a prototype chain which could be delivered to Theia at the end of 2016.",

    "detailed_description": "Antarctica, one of the least understood natural areas on Earth, is threatened by human disturbance and climate-related changes, underscoring the imperative for biodiversity inventories to inform conservation.Antarctic ecosystems support species and genetic components of biodiversity, ecosystem services and planetary stability. Here we present Antarctica’s first comprehensive ecosystem classification and maps of ice-free land, which hosts most of the continent’s documented terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity. We shaped a tiered approach using latent variables in a factor analysis to partitioned continental-scale abiotic variation, then biotic variation represented in spatial models, and finally recognised regional-scale variation among biogeographic units. This produced a spatially explicit classification with five environment types (tier 1), 31 habitats (tier 2) and 309 regional ecosystems (tier 3) mapped at 100 m resolution and aligned with ‘level 4’ of the IUCN global ecosystem typology. This first comprehensive ecosystem inventory will support the Antarctic Treaty’s Environmental Protocol with foundational data for identifying protected areas and tracking risks to Antarctic ecosystems. It’s tiered structure and workflow accommodate data scarcity and facilitate efficient updates which promoting robustness as knowledge builds.",

The maps provided by GLAD do not have these properties. However, the maps can be leveraged to facilitate appropriate probability-based statistical methods in deriving statistically valid areas of forest extent and change. Specifically, the maps may be used as a stratifier in targeting forest extent and/or change by a probability sample. The team at GLAD has demonstrated such approaches using the GLAD forest loss data in sample-based area estimation (Tyukavina et al., ERL, 2018, Turubanova et al., ERL, 2019, and Potapov et al., RSE, 2019, among others).",

The global 30-m spatial resolution dataset quantifies changes in forest extent and height, cropland, built-up lands, surface water, and perennial snow and ice extent from the year 2000 to 2020. Landsat Analysis Ready Data served as an input for land cover and use mapping. Each thematic product was independently derived using locally and regionally calibrated machine learning tools. Thematic maps validation using a statistical sample of reference data confirmed their high accuracy (user’s and producer’s accuracies above 85% for all land cover and land use themes, except for built-up lands). Our results revealed dramatic changes in global land cover and land use over the past 20 years.

    "abstract": "We thus create a high-resolution classification map of China’s Coastal Land Covers (CCLC) at 10 m in 2020 (Fig. 1). A selection of zoomed-in representative sites (Fig. 2a–f) shows that we can clearly identify the type, composition, pattern, and distribution of different coastal land covers from our new map of the “Great Sea Wall of China”. Quantitatively, our map reveals a high spatial heterogeneity across nine regions of China’s LSI (Fig. S5 online). As a whole, cropland (33,780 km2, 26.02%), tree cover (32,172 km2, 24.78%), and impervious surface (26,323 km2, 20.27%) account for two-thirds of China’s LSI area. A large proportion of the LSI’s cropland is distributed in the northern part (Fig. 1). Bare land, shrubland, and grassland account for 4.02% (5222 km2), 4.81% (6246 km2), and 5.17% (6713 km2), respectively. As a major fish producer and exporter, our map detects that China has 8536 km2 of coastal artificial wetlands (6.57% of its LSI coastal zone). Natural wetlands including mudflats, herbaceous wetlands, mangroves, and sandy beach account for 4.98% (6465 km2), 2.82% (3665 km2), 0.27% (354 km2), and 0.28% (364 km2), respectively. Although accounting for less than 10% in total, these natural wetlands play a vital role in promoting tourism, conserving coastal biodiversity, storing carbon, and serving as natural protection against storms and floods.",

This map represents the current extent of each Plant Community Type, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation, across all tenures in NSW. This map is updated periodically as part of the Integrated BioNet Vegetation Data program to improve quality and alignment to the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy.\n\nThe map is supplied as ESRI Feature Class (Quickview) and 5m GeoTiff Raster, and can be viewed and analysed in most commercial and open-source spatial software packages. If you prefer to use the download package, we supply an ArcGIS v10.4 mxd and/or a layer file for suggested symbology. The raster attributes contain PCT, Vegetation Class and Vegetation Formation.",
    "detailed_description": "The State Vegetation Type Map (SVTM) is a regional-scale map of the 3 levels of the NSW vegetation classification hierarchy.\n\nIt maps the distribution of each plant community type (PCT), vegetation class and vegetation formation across all tenures in New South Wales.\n\nThere are 2 separate map products.\n\n1) The State Vegetation Type Map extant map shows the distribution of the plant community types within the limits of present-day native vegetation cover across New South Wales.\n2) The State Vegetation Type Map pre-clearing map displays the likely distribution of plant community types before the loss of native vegetation cover. The pre-clearing map for central New South Wales is currently in preparation.\nThe State Vegetation Type Map helps government, business and the community to understand the composition and relative importance of native vegetation in their local area. It helps decision makers to better recognise the different groupings of native vegetation in their area and make more informed land management or conservation investment decisions.\n\nBy using the map, land use planning and on-ground actions are better matched to the characteristics of the vegetation being managed. For example, it facilitates selection of the best native species mix to rehabilitate disturbed areas.\n\nThe State Vegetation Type Map is created and maintained using a method for regional-scale mapping of plant community types (PCTs). The State Vegetation Type Map method can be found in the NSW State Vegetation Type Map technical notes.\n\nThe method uses on-ground surveys, aerial and satellite photograph interpretation and landscape models to map the most likely plant community types. While much of the map is regional-scale information, some fine-scale mapping has been selectively included.\n\nWe will include further fine-scale mapping in the future, as well as updates and revisions as better information becomes available. Systematic validation of the maps is progressively undertaken by independent ecologists and reported as part of the annual update.\n\nThe map's overall spatial precision (line work) is about 5 metres. Spatial precision is facilitated by computer-generated feature recognition software.\n\nAerial photographic interpretation is prepared between 1:10000 and 1:20000 scale.\n\nAttribution accuracy (plant community type) depends on the number of vegetation classes being mapped and the quality and number of surveys available for each plant community type.\n\nSome plant community types can be mapped with high accuracy, reliably representing their distribution. Others have very little survey information available, so accuracy of the map will be limited. Some plant community types have so little survey data that they cannot be mapped at a regional scale.\n\nWe are validating the State Vegetation Type Map iteratively as resources become available. Our general aim is to ensure that it averages at least 70% accuracy on the ground.",

    "abstract": "Human-transformed agricultural and aquacultural ponds, collectively referred to as “dike-pond systems”, play a crucial role in ensuring food security but also contribute to the widespread loss of natural wetlands. However, spatially and temporally explicit patterns of dike-pond systems have not been thoroughly documented globally. Here, we map the distribution of dike-pond systems over both global inland and coastal regions during three periods (1984 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, 2011 to 2020) using 30-m resolution satellite observations. Results show that the total area of dike-pond systems was 132,886 km2 globally, with about 2/3 contributed from inland wetlands. From 1984 to 2020, the net gain of inland dike-pond systems (26,385 km2 or 92.7%) was 1.6 times that of coastal wetlands (16,371 km2 or 83.3%), due primarily to reduced coastal dike-pond systems in the last decade. We identified significant contributions of dike-pond systems to fishery production, and further revealed occurrences of dike-pond systems within protected areas. Our study highlights the importance of prioritizing the conservation and management of more intensively inland dike-pond systems, and our global synthesis provides a critical benchmark for assessing potential consequences of dike-pond system and for future restoration efforts.",

    "title": "Mapping the world’s inland surface waters: an update to the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD v2)",
    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "In recognition of the importance of inland waters, numerous datasets mapping their extents, types, or changes have been created using sources ranging from historical wetland maps to real-time satellite remote sensing. However, differences in definitions and methods have led to spatial and typological inconsistencies among individual data sources, confounding their complementary use and integration. The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD), published in 2004, with its globally seamless gridded depiction of major vegetated and non-vegetated wetland classes, has emerged over the last decades as a foundational reference map that has advanced research and conservation planning addressing freshwater biodiversity, ecosystem services, greenhouse gas emissions, land surface processes, hydrology, and human health. Here, we present a new iteration of this map, termed GLWD version 2, generated by harmonizing the latest ground- and satellite-based data products into one single database. Following the same design principle as its predecessor, GLWD v2 aims to avoid double-counting of overlapping surface water features while differentiating between natural and non-natural lakes, rivers of multiple sizes, and several other wetland types. The classification of GLWD v2 incorporates information on seasonality (i.e., permanent vs. intermittent vs. ephemeral); inundation vs. saturation (i.e., flooding vs. waterlogged soils); vegetation cover (e.g., forested swamps vs. non-forested marshes); salinity (e.g., salt pans); natural vs. non-natural origins (e.g., rice paddies); and a stratification of landscape position and water source (e.g., riverine, lacustrine, palustrine, coastal/marine). GLWD v2 represents 33 wetland classes and—including all intermittent classes—depicts a maximum of 18.2 million km2 of wetlands (13.4 % of the global land area excluding Antarctica). The spatial extent of each class is provided as the fractional coverage within each grid cell at a resolution of 15 arc-seconds (approximately 500 m at the equator), with cell fractions derived from input data at resolutions as small as 10 m. The updated GLWD v2 offers an improved representation of inland surface water extents and their classification for contemporary conditions. Despite being a static map, it includes classes that denote intrinsic temporal dynamics.

    "abstract": "Peatlands play important ecological, economic and cultural roles in human well-being. Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23 million km2, approximately 2.84% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database – Level 3 (GLWD-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. PEATMAP and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands. PEATMAP's data format and file structure are intended to allow it to be readily updated when previously undocumented peatlands are found and mapped, and when regional or national land cover maps are updated and refined.",

We quantified changing flood risk due to extreme events using an integrated set of global environmental, geophysical, and social indicators. Although risks are distributed across all levels of economic development, wealthy countries effectively limit their present-day threat by gross domestic product–enabled infrastructure and coastal defense investments. In an energy-constrained future, such protections will probably prove to be unsustainable, raising relative risks by four to eight times in the Mississippi and Rhine deltas and by one-and-a-half to four times in the Chao Phraya and Yangtze deltas. The current emphasis on short-term solutions for the world’s deltas will greatly constrain options for designing sustainable solutions in the long term.",

    "detailed_description": "Climate change shifts ecosystems, altering their compositions and instigating transitions, making climate change the predominant driver of ecosystem instability. Land management agencies experience these climatic effects on ecosystems they administer yet lack applied information to inform mitigation. We address this gap, explaining ecosystem shifts by building relationships between the historical locations of 22 ecosystems (c. 2000) and abiotic data (1970–2000; bioclimate, terrain) within the southwestern United States using ‘ensemble’ machine learning models. These relationships identify the conditions required for establishing and maintaining southwestern ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem suitability). We projected these historical relationships to mid (2041–2060) and end-of-century (2081–2100) periods using CMIP6 generation BCC-CSM2-MR and GFDL-ESM4 climate models with SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 emission scenarios. This procedure reveals how ecosystems shift, as suitability typically increases in area (~ 50% (~ 40% SD)), elevation (12–15%) and northing (4–6%) by mid-century. We illustrate where and when ecosystems shift, by mapping suitability predictions temporally and within 52,565 properties (e.g., Federal, State, Tribal). All properties had ≥ 50% changes in suitability for ≥ 1 ecosystem within them, irrespective of size (≥ 16.7 km2). We integrated 9 climate models to quantify predictive uncertainty and exemplify its relevance. Agencies must manage ecosystem shifts transcending jurisdictions. Effective mitigation requires collective action heretofore rarely instituted. Our procedure supplies the climatic context to inform their decisions.",

Detailed information on the extent and distribution of marsh vegetation zones throughout the Northern Gulf coast has been historically unavailable. In response, the U.S. Geological Survey, in collaboration with the Gulf Coast Joint Venture, the University of Louisiana-Lafayette, Ducks Unlimited, Inc., and Texas A&M University - Kingsville, has produced a classification of four types of marsh vegetation for Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This study incorporates approximately 8,800 ground reference locations collected via helicopter surveys in coastal Texas and Louisiana marsh areas. These data were used for assessing accuracy. Decision-tree analyses using Rulequest See5 were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using these data, multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2010, a bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables believed to be important for delineating the extent and distribution of marsh vegetation communities. Image objects were generated from segmentation of high-resolution airborne imagery acquired in 2010 and were used to refine the classification",
    "detailed_description": "The classification was developed in two phases. The first phase extended from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Sabine River, Louisiana and the second phase extended from the Sabine River, Louisiana to the the Perdido River, Alabama. An alternative classification containing only three marsh types was created for coastal Texas, in which, intermediate and brackish marsh were combined into a single class. For more information, please see the U.S. Geological Survey Investigations Report titled \"Delineation of Marsh Types of the Texas Coast from Corpus Christi Bay to the Sabine River in 2010.\" The marsh vegetation classes and ground reference locations for Louisiana can also be viewed in the Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) interactive viewer where it can be compared with historical vegetation classification layers. A poster of the Louisiana map is also available. This study provides a more objective and repeatable method for classifying marsh types of the Northern Gulf coast at an extent and greater level of detail than previously available for the study area. The seamless classification produced through this work is now available to help State agencies and landscape-scale conservation partnerships (such as the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the Gulf Coast Joint Venture) to develop and (or) refine conservation plans targeting priority natural resources. Moreover, these data may improve projections of landscape change and serve as a baseline for monitoring future changes resulting from chronic and episodic stressors.",

Decision-tree analyses using Rulequest See5 were used to classify emergent marsh vegetation types by using these data, multitemporal satellite-based multispectral imagery from 2010, a bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) based on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), alternative contemporary land cover classifications, and other spatially explicit variables believed to be important for delineating the extent and distribution of marsh vegetation communities. Image objects were generated from segmentation of high-resolution airborne imagery acquired in 2010 and were used to refine the classification.\n\nThe classification was developed in two phases. The first phase extended from Corpus Christi, Texas to the Sabine River, Louisiana and the second phase extended from the Sabine River, Louisiana to the the Perdido River, Alabama. An alternative classification containing only three marsh types was created for coastal Texas, in which, intermediate and brackish marsh were combined into a single class. For more information, please see the U.S. Geological Survey Investigations Report titled \"Delineation of Marsh Types of the Texas Coast from Corpus Christi Bay to the Sabine River in 2010.\" The marsh vegetation classes and ground reference locations for Louisiana can also be viewed in the Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) interactive viewer where it can be compared with historical vegetation classification layers. A poster of the Louisiana map is also available.\n\nThis study provides a more objective and repeatable method for classifying marsh types of the Northern Gulf coast at an extent and greater level of detail than previously available for the study area. The seamless classification produced through this work is now available to help State agencies and landscape-scale conservation partnerships (such as the Gulf Coast Prairie Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the Gulf Coast Joint Venture) to develop and (or) refine conservation plans targeting priority natural resources. Moreover, these data may improve projections of landscape change and serve as a baseline for monitoring future changes resulting from chronic and episodic stressors.",

    "abstract": "Since 1997, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) geoscientists have identified and mapped over 12,000 seafloor seismic amplitude anomalies (areas of anomalously high or low reflectivity response over background response) in the deep water Gulf of Mexico (GOM) using 3-D time migrated seismic surveys, with most areas having overlapping coverage by two or more surveys (a total of 156,000 square miles were interpreted). The water bottom horizon was completely mapped over these surveys using hand interpreted seed lines, and Geoframe's automatic picking program to fill in the gaps. The seismic amplitude was then displayed in plan view. Anomalously high positive and low positive/negative amplitudes were identified and outlined using polygons. The amplitude maps were cross checked with the vertical seismic profiles to verify the interpretation. Below most of the amplitude anomalies, blanking and/or visible migration pathways are visible in vertical seismic profiles in the subsurface up to the water bottom. Well over 100 of the anomalies have been confirmed as seeps using submersible, ROV, AUV, and camera sled surveys, piston cores and trawls, by BOEMRE, NOAA, and industry contractors.",

    "abstract": "Seagrass ecosystems are among the most productive and valuable benthic habitats found in the in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico region. They support a diverse array of ecological and habitat functions, as well as various human activities along the Gulf Coast. Maintaining and improving the health of seagrass ecosystems and all coastal and marine ecosystems are essential for ensuring the ecological and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico region. Seagrass habitats provide nursery areas for extensive recreationally and commercially significant marine life by providing spawning and foraging habitat for many species of finfish, shellfish, and crustaceans. Smaller species and juveniles find protection from predation in seagrass canopy cover. Seagrasses provide food and feeding habitat for wintering waterfowl and other water birds. Seagrasses also support many threatened and endangered species, such as sea turtles, manatees, and bottlenose dolphins, which eat seagrass leaves and/or feed on smaller animals found in seagrass habitats. Epiphytes and benthic organisms attach to and colonize seagrasses, providing food for many marine animals. The extensive plant biomass of seagrass beds feeds bacteria and microscopic animals at the base of a complex food web. Seagrass roots and rhizomes form an intricately interwoven, underground mat that stabilizes the shallow bottom sediment on the seafloor, while simultaneously contributing to water clarity and decreasing wave energy by trapping sediment through waves and currents in their leaves. Trapping sediment cleanses the water from fine particles, and uptake of dissolved nutrients by seagrass will reduce the overgrowth of algae as well, thereby significantly improving water quality. Changes in seagrass habitat distribution can indicate decreased water quality and poor overall health of coastal waters. Loss of seagrass habitats can lead not only to decreased water quality, but also to increased water column turbidity, shoreline erosion, and the loss of the varied habitat functions that seagrass ecosystems provide. The many valuable functions provided by seagrass habitats support the ecosystem and contribute to economic activities. Commercial and recreational fisheries and tourism are several of the top industries in the Gulf region. These activities bring hundreds of millions of dollars into local communities and are directly influenced by the health and productivity of such marine ecosystems as seagrass habitats.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the spatial and temporal changes in ecosystems is essential to account for natural capital contribution to human well-being. However, various methods to quantify these changes challenge the development of reliable values which can be integrated into national statistical accounts. Following the international system of environmental-economic accounting framework, which recently adopts an ecosystem accounting standard. We present a novel approach to develop an ecosystem extent account from existing ecosystem classifications. This study shows the spatial and statistical extent account of 26 ecosystems (i.e. forests, grasslands, croplands, and urban, among others) between 1970 and 2015 at the national scale. Extent accounts were developed at a resolution of 25 m and provided reliable information on how ecosystem types have changed over time in Spain. Our results reflect three main patterns in the extension account: (i) an increase in forest ecosystems, (ii) a considerable decrease in agroecosystems (especially annual croplands), and (iii) substantial development of urban areas. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first attempt to develop a robust methodology to measure the extent of ecosystems at the national level. The proposed approach is crucial for a strong knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and their implications for ecosystem conditions and services at a national level. This has potential applications in urban planning, green infrastructure development, and multiple uses for territory management and policies, integrating natural capital into official statistics and mainstreaming ecosystems into national-level planning and monitoring processes.",

    "abstract": "This vegetation map shows the extant distributions of vegetation classes throughout NSW, and provides users with information about the resolution, currency and uncertainties in the underlying data that were used to assemble the map. Data represents NSW native vegetation extent, compiled from various vegetation maps using methods outlined in Simpson et al. (2011) and in Keith and Simpson (2010). \n\nThe NSW vegetation map (version 2.2, Keith and Simpson 2006) was revised by interpreting additional candidate maps as vector layers and synthesising these into a single raster-based data set. This involved eight steps: developing a comprehensive 'standard' classification of vegetation classes for NSW; collating and standardising the projection and format of candidate source maps; assigning vegetation units of source maps to NSW vegetation classes; assessing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of candidate source maps; assembling a composite map from candidate source maps to maximise reliability; applying a spatial mask to represent extant native vegetation; adjusting spatial resolution by dissolving small polygons and converting to 200 m raster; attributing the spatial resolution, currency and reliability of the underlying source data sets. \n\nThe classification of 106 vegetation classes described by Keith (2004) was adopted as the framework for preparation of version 3.03 of the NSW vegetation map. Polygons from the \"Estuarine macrophytes CCA\" dataset of less than 0.1 ha were eliminated. For all other datasets polygons of less than 2 ha were eliminated. The map incorporates data from a statewide woody vegetation mask from the NSW Woody Vegetation Change Detection Program (Kitchen et al. 2010). \n\nThe map is presented as a raster within an ESRI ArcGIS (9.3) geodatabase. Supersedes Keith and Simpson (2006), Keith (2004) and Pressey et al. (2000). Pressey et al. (2000) was the native veg extent product used to calculate native veg cover values for the Over-Cleared Landscapes Database prior to July 2006. \n\nReferences: Keith D. A.

The dataset was developed to provide a baseline inventory of the extent of our knowledge regarding the global distribution of saltmarshes, which are ecosystems located in the intertidal zone of sheltered marine and estuarine coastlines. These ecosystems comprise brackish, shallow water with salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses and shrubs, and are commonly found at temperate and high latitudes. Saltmarshes are of ecological importance as they underpin the estuarine food web. In particular, saltmarshes serve as nesting, nursery and feeding grounds for numerous species of birds, fish, molluscs and crustaceans, including commercially important fish species such as herring (Clupea harengus), and are also home to a number of Endangered and Critically Endangered species.",

The annual time series of forest land cover maps are national in scope (entire 650 million hectare forested ecosystem) and represent a wall-to-wall land cover characterization yearly from 1984 to 2022. These time-series land cover maps were produced from annual time-series of Landsat image composites, forest change information, and ancillary topographic and hydrologic data following the framework described in Hermosilla et al. (2022), which builds upon the approach introduced in Hermosilla et al. (2018). The methodological innovations included (i) a refined training pool derived from existing land cover products using airborne and spaceborne measures of forest structure; (ii) selection of training samples proportionally to the land cover distribution using a distance=weighted approach; and (iii) generation of regional classification models using a 150x150 km tiling system. Maps are post-processed using disturbance information to ensure logical class transitions over time using a Hidden Markov Model. Hidden Markov Models assess individual year class likelihoods to reduce variability and possible noise in year-on-year class assignments (for instances when class likelihoods are similar).",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem accounting is a tool to integrate nature into decision-making in a more structured way. Applying the use of nationally available datasets at catchment scale and following the System of Environmental Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) framework, we present results from a catchment case study in Ireland, highlighting findings specifically in relation to the development of ecosystem extent and condition accounts. In the absence of a national ecosystem map, CORINE landcover mapping formed the basic data for extent and type of ecosystems, distinguishing woodlands and forest, peatland and heathland, grasslands and cropland and urban areas, with limited coverage of linear freshwater rivers, hedgerows and coastal ecosystems. Additional remote sensing data provided higher resolution at catchment scale, while limited site-level survey data were available. Condition data gathered for reporting under the EU Water Framework Directive were available at sub-basin level for surface waterbodies. Data were available at national level for habitats reported for the EU under the Habitats Directive (59 habitats reported), covering ~ 25% of the study area. Data for ecosystem types outside of these reporting frameworks were in the form of ancillary data only, providing information on pressures, threats and intensity of use. Our findings in Ireland reflect work across the European region, highlighting the role of data gathering and stakeholder engagement. We outline some of the data gaps to provide information for future research and alignment of data for the purpose of NCA, both at catchment and national scale.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "Time-series studies have reported trophic cascades in land, freshwater and marine environments in many geographic areas. However, the spatial extent of habitats, a key metric of ecosystem structure, has not been mapped in these studies. Marine reserves can provide experimental, before–after and inside–outside (control-impacted), situations for assessing the impact of fishing on ecosystems. We mapped seabed habitats and their associated communities (biotopes) in New Zealand’s oldest marine reserve for comparison with pre-reserve maps created about 30 years previously.\nAreas grazed bare by sea urchins were entirely replaced in the centre of the reserve by kelp, or alga turf, an intermediate biotope between heavily grazed encrusting algae and lightly grazed kelp. Urchins declined following increased abundance and body size of spiny (rock) lobsters and fish (especially snapper) in the reserve but maintained bare rock outside. While this gradient in habitat change matched the gradient of predator abundance, it also matched the extent of reef habitat area. Thus the trophic cascade may be influenced by the effect of habitat on the abundance and behavioural interactions of urchins and their predators. Further ecosystem changes may arise should the abundance of mega-predators, such as seals, cetaceans and large sharks, increase in the region; if parasites become pathogenic; and/or when invasive species reach the reserve.\nNo-take marine reserves provide real-world experiments that show the importance of species in food webs, and the consequences of fishing for ecosystems. Because these changes in ecosystem structure may continue, and will vary with environment, climate and species distributions, reserves need to be permanent and replicated geographically. Habitat maps should be produced for all reserves to enable ecological changes in the ecosystem to be spatially quantified.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "The United Nations System of Environmental and Economic Accounting - Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) is a geospatial approach, whereby existing data on ecosystem stocks and flows are collated to show changes over time. The framework has been proposed as a means to track and monitor ecosystem restoration targets across the EU. Condition is a key consideration in the conservation assessment of habitats protected under the EU Habitats Directive and ecosystem condition accounts are also integral to the SEEA EA. While SEEA EA accounts have been developed at EU level for an array for ecosystem types, condition accounts remain the least developed. Collating available datasets under the SEEA EA framework, we developed extent and rudimentary condition accounts for peatland ecosystems at catchment scale in Ireland. Information relating to peatland ecosystem sub-types or habitat types was collated for peatland habitats listed under Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, as well as degraded peatlands not included in EU nature conservation networks. While data relating to peatland condition were limited, understanding changes in ecosystem extent and incorporating knowledge of habitat types and degradation served as a proxy for ecosystem condition in the absence of more comprehensive data. This highlighted the importance of the ecosystem extent account, which underpins all other accounts in the SEEA EA framework. Reflecting findings at EU level, drainage, disturbance and land conversion were identified as the main pressures affecting peatland condition. We highlighted a number of options to gather data to build more robust, time-series extent and condition accounts for peatlands at varying accounting scales. Overall, despite the absence of comprehensive data, bringing information under the SEEA EA framework is considered a good starting point, with the integration of expert ecological opinion considered essential to ensure development of reliable accounts, particularly when working at ecosystem sub-type (habitat type) and catchment scale.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems yet recorded. Collectively, they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle, with wide-ranging estimates of their global area (441 025–1700 000 km2) and below-ground carbon storage (105–288 Pg C). Substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions, including most of tropical South America. Here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first field-data-driven model of peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. Our model predicts a total Amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 (95th percentile confidence interval: 128 671–373 359), greater than that of the Congo basin, but around 30% smaller than a recent model-derived estimate of peatland area across Amazonia. The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling. This new map can facilitate future research into the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change and anthropogenic impacts, which is likely to vary spatially across the Amazon basin.",

However, effective conservation and its potential to provide nature-based solutions to climate change is hindered by major uncertainties regarding seagrass extent and distribution. Here, we describe the characterization of the world’s largest seagrass ecosystem, located in The Bahamas. We integrate existing spatial estimates with an updated empirical remote sensing product and perform extensive groundtruthing of the seafloor with 2,542 diver surveys across remote sensing tiles. We also leverage seafloor assessments and movement data obtained from instrument-equipped tiger sharks, which have strong fidelity to seagrass ecosystems, to augment and further validate predictions. We report a consensus area of at least 66,000 km2 and up to 92,000 km2 of seagrass habitat across The Bahamas Banks. Sediment core analysis of stored organic carbon further confirmed the global relevance of the blue carbon stock in this ecosystem. Data from tiger sharks proved important in supporting mapping and groundtruthing remote sensing estimates. This work provides evidence of major knowledge gaps in the ocean ecosystem, the benefits in partnering with marine animals to address these gaps, and underscores support for rapid protection of oceanic carbon sinks.",

    "language": "english",
    "abstract": "In the early 1980’s, the European Commission recognized the need for a comprehensive, detailed, and harmonized dataset on the land cover and land use of the European continent. At that time, national land cover maps were often inconsistent and incomparable across borders, making the prospect of monitoring the European environment at a continental scale all but impossible. In response, the European Commission launched the CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) program in an effort to develop a standardized methodology for producing continent-scale land cover, biotope, and air quality maps. In 1990, the first CORINE Land Cover dataset was produced. Since then, it has become a flagship component of the European Environment Agency’s Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, where it has provided essential information on European land cover/land use for over three decades.\nIn its current form, the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) product offers a pan-European land cover and land use inventory with 44 thematic classes, ranging from broad forested areas to individual vineyards. The product is updated with new status and change layers every six years—with the most recent update made in 2018. CLC serves a multitude of users and has nearly limitless potential and actual applications, including environmental monitoring, land use planning, climate change assessments, and emergency management.",
    "detailed_description": "Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme. It offers information services based on satellite Earth observation and in situ (non-space) data. These information services are freely and openly accessible to their users through six thematic Copernicus services (atmosphere monitoring,\nmarine environment monitoring, land monitoring, climate change, emergency management and\nsecurity). The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) provides geographical information on land cover and its changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and earth surface energy variables to a broad range\nof users in Europe and across the world in the field of environmental terrestrial applications. CLMS is jointly implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission DG Joint Research Centre (JRC). CORINE Land Cover (CLC) is the oldest and most sought-after database of CLMS. CLC was specified to standardize data collection related to land in Europe to support environmental policy development. The reference year of the first CLC inventory was 1990 (CLC1990), and the first update was created in 2000. Further inventories followed with an update cycle of 6 years. The project is implemented by\nnational teams under the management, guidance and close quality control of EEA. The number of participating countries has increased over time − currently includes 32 EEA member countries and the UK and six cooperating countries (EEA38 and the UK) with a total area of nearly 6 Mkm2\n. Orthocorrected high spatial resolution satellite images provide the geometrical and thematic basis for mapping. In-situ data (topographic maps, ortho-photos and ground survey data) are essential ancillary information. The basic technical parameters of CLC have not changed since the beginning: 1) the nomenclature including 44 classes (on level-3) in five main land cover / use groups: Artificial surfaces, Agriculture, Forests and seminatural areas, Wetlands and Water; 2) the geometric detail: 25 hectare\nminimum mapping unit (MMU) and 100 meter minimum mapping width (MMW). The layer of CORINE Land Cover Changes (CLC-Change) is produced since the second CLC inventory (CLC2000). CLC-Change is created by direct mapping of changes taking place between two consecutive inventories, based on visual image-to-image comparison of satellite images. Change mapping applies a 5 ha MMU to pick up more detail in the CLC-Change layer than in the CLC status layer. Integration of national CLC and CLCChange data includes some harmonization along national borders. European validation studies have shown that the achieved thematic accuracy is above the specified minimum (85 %). Primary CLC and\nCLC-Change data are produced in vector format with polygon topology. Derived products in raster format are also available. The seamless European CLC and CLC-Change time series data (CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012, CLC2018 and related CLC-Change data) are distributed in the standard European Coordinate Reference System defined by the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) datum and Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG: 3035). Results of the CLC inventories can be downloaded from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service site free of charge for all users for any use. CLC data contribute to a wide range of studies and applications with European coverage, e.g.: ecosystem mapping, modelling the impacts of climate change, landscape fragmentation by roads, abandonment of farmland and major structural changes in agriculture, urban sprawl, water management. A harmonization methodology has been developed to allow a statistically solid basis for CLC time series analysis by means of the so-called CLC accounting layers. The future CLC+ concept is under development, aiming the continuation of the CLC time series, by\nmaking benefit of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery (ESA Sentinels), thematic data\nprovided by Member States and advanced information extraction techniques.",

    "title": "Vegetation Zones of Canada: a Biogeoclimatic Perspective",
    "language": "english/french",
    "abstract": "Vegetation Zones of Canada: a Biogeoclimatic Perspective\" maps Canadian geography in relation to gradients of regional climate, as expressed by potential vegetation on zonal sites. Compared to previous similar national-scale products, \"Vegetation Zones of Canada\" benefits from the work of provincial and territorial ecological classification programs over the last 30+ years, incorporating this regional knowledge of ecologically significant climatic gradients into a harmonized national map. This new map, reflecting vegetation and soils adapted to climates prior to approximately 1960, can serve as a broad-scale (approximately 1:5 M to 1:10 M) geospatial reference for monitoring and modeling effects of climate changes on Canadian ecosystems.",
    "detailed_description": "Vegetation Zones of Canada: a Biogeoclimatic Perspective\" employs a two-level hierarchical legend. Level 1 vegetation zones reflect the global-scale latitudinal gradient of annual net radiation, as well as the effects of high elevation and west to east climatic and biogeographic variation across Canada. Within the level 1 vegetation zones, level 2 zones distinguish finer scale variation in zonal vegetation, especially in response to elevational and arctic climatic gradients, climate-related floristics and physiognomic diversity in the Great Plains, and maritime climatic influences on the east and west coasts .",
