    question: "What is the primary goal of the Global Ecosystems Atlas Basemap?",
    answer:
      "The primary goal of the gea_basemap is to create a dynamic and high-resolution global map of ecosystems. This map is intended to support environmental management and biodiversity monitoring by providing detailed and accurate ecosystem classifications.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes the gea_basemap unique?",
    answer:
      "The gea_basemap stands out due to its combination of high-resolution data, dynamic updates, and integration of multiple datasets into a unified framework. This makes it an essential tool for global environmental monitoring and management efforts.",
  },
  {
    question: "How was the data for the basemap compiled?",
    answer:
      "The data was compiled by aggregating existing ecosystem maps. These maps underwent a rigorous evaluation process, including quality assessment based on spatial resolution, accuracy, and ecological relevance. Experts reviewed the data to ensure alignment with the IUCN Global Ecosystems Typology, and the datasets were then reclassified, resampled, and compiled into the gea_basemap.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is correspondence analysis, and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "Estimating the correspondence of map classes from various source datasets to the IUCN Global Ecosystems Typology framework is an essential step in the harmonisation procedure developed for the Global Ecosystems Atlas. This step, which is sometimes called a crosswalk, is crucial to integrating data from a very large variety of different datasets and allows for a unified global representation of ecosystems in the geo_basemap data product.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is the gea_basemap kept up to date?",
    answer:
      "The gea_basemap is designed to be a dynamic data product, continuously updated with new data. A versioning system is in place to integrate the latest ecosystem information, ensuring that the basemap remains a current and valuable resource.",
  },
  {
    question: "What visual aids are available to help understand the methodology?",
    answer: "The following visual aids are available:",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I find more information on the tools and methodologies used?",
    answer: "Additional resources include:",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the known issues on the data?",
    answer: "Known issues are tracked in [link to the known issues document]",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I report any issue?",
    answer:
      "If you notice If you notice incorrect values or missing data or if the platform isn't working correctly, like a broken feature or a technical problem, you can report it to us through [reporting methods define].",
  },
