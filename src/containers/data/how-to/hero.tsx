              The Global Ecosystems Atlas Basemap (gea_basemap) is a data product designed to
              support environmental initiatives by providing a{" "}
              <strong>consistent spatial dataset</strong>
              representing ecosystems worldwide. The development of the basemap involved the
              compilation and harmonization of existing, publicly available assets that are known to
              represent ecosystems and that meet stringent data quality standards. Key processes in
              the development of the basemap include data compilation, quality assurance, assigning
              map classes to their corresponding IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology class, and
              integration into a data product that can support a variety of use cases.Â
