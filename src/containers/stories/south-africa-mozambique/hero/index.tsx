      <p className="text-xl">
        South Africa and Mozambique, though neighboring countries with shared ecosystems, have
        distinct histories, languages, and conservation challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl">

        resources and climate change.

        heritage and how the Global Ecosystems Atlas is supporting that endeavor.
