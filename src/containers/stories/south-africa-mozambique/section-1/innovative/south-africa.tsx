        Both South Africa and Mozambique have made significant strides in mapping and classifying
        their ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl">
        <strong>South Africa&apos;s</strong> mapping efforts date back several decades, involving
        many ecologists using a wide range of data sources, resulting in maps of around 1000
        ecosystem types across all realms. This provides a wealth of data that has guided
        conservation action, integrated spatial planning, environmental impact assessments and more.
